This TODO list is not a complete roadmap for QLC+. It just contains random
notes and issues found while doing something else. Kind of like a notepad or
something.

Massimo's notes:

* review/restore Function Wizard
* improve multitrack view resize to display a longer time
* should be possible to pause/resume a show
* insert EFX on sequences ??

Heikki's notes:

* Sanity check for functions and fixtures:
* After loading, check if all fixtures, channels and member functions
  are present and usable. If not, remove them.
* When a fixture def is changed for an existing fixture, functions should
  check if their channel & fixture bindings are still valid. 
* After loading and changing fixture def, VC widgets should check if
  their functions, fixtures and channels are still valid.

offtool's notes:

* add possiblity to capture channels (done)
  Capture a channel through togglebutton in a channelfader widget.
  ** Use: set a channel permanent to zero if a gel is burned,
     adjust values of a scene (lower some values) and update scene in cuelist via
     the new record/update button
  ** Behaviour: if button is pushed, channel snaps to the current value,
    a captured channel overrides scene value of a running scene or values other faders.
    Further features: T-Bar like widget fader to manipulate a bunch of captures channels
* add progressbar for up and downfades in Cuelist
* add solo channels capility / fixture ignores grandmaster (for non LTP fiytures)
  a Solo Intensity Channel value is not affected by the Grandmaster
  ** Use: Shutter of a projector which uses no specfific fixture definition
*add possiblity to patch one fixture to multiple channels
  ** Use: you have a set and play in another venue, where you have 4 Fresnel as Front instead of 3.
     Instead of adding one fixture to all cues in your Cuelist, you can simply patch one more channel
     to one of your exisiting frontlight fixture.
* add festures for the Enttec Wing (Go/Back Button, page changes). Page changes should ignore channels, which are set on a diffent page until they are newly touched and reach their actual level
* Tabular overview of the all channels and chasersteps used in a chaser (possibility to edit blind)
* Cuelist Record (Overwrite, Record New, per Step Times)
