This TODO list is not a complete roadmap for QLC+. It just contains random
notes and issues found while doing something else. Kind of like a notepad or
something.

Massimo's notes:

* review/restore Function Wizard
* improve multitrack view resize to display a longer time
* should be possible to pause/resume a show
* insert EFX on sequences ??
* add native ArtNet I/O plugin

Heikki's notes:

* Sanity check for functions and fixtures:
* After loading, check if all fixtures, channels and member functions
  are present and usable. If not, remove them.
* When a fixture def is changed for an existing fixture, functions should
  check if their channel & fixture bindings are still valid.
* After loading and changing fixture def, VC widgets should check if
  their functions, fixtures and channels are still valid.

offtool's notes:

* add possiblity to capture channels 
  Capture a channel through togglebutton in a channelfader widget.
  ** Use: set a channel permanent to zero if a gel is burned,
     adjust values of a scene (lower some values) and update scene in cuelist via
     the new record/update button
  ** Behaviour: if button is pushed, channel snaps to the current value,
    a captured channel overrides scene value of a running scene or values other faders.
    Further features: T-Bar like widget fader to manipulate a bunch of captures channels
* add progressbar for up and downfades in Cuelist
* add solo channels capility
  a Solo Intensity Channel value is not affected by the Grandmaster
  ** Use: Shutter of a projector which uses no specfific fixture definition
