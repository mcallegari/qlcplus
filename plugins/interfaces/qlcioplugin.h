/**
 * QLCIOPlugin is an interface for all input/output plugins.
 *
 * Each plugin must provide at least one output and/or input line in order
 * to work at all. Then again, if there are no such devices currently
 * connected to the computer that would be supported by the plugin, the plugin
 * can choose to provide no lines at all (until the user plugs in a supported
 * device).
 *
 * When QLC has successfully loaded a plugin, it will call init() exactly
 * once for that plugin. After that, it is assumed that either the
 * plugin auto-senses the devices it supports or the user must manually try
 * to search for new devices thru a custom configuration dialog that can be
 * opened with configure().
 *
 * Plugins should not leave any resources open unless open() is called. And
 * even then, the plugin should open only such resources that are needed for
 * the specific I/O line given in the call to openOutput() or openInput().
 * Respectively, when closeOutput() or closeInput() is called, the plugin
 * should relinquish all resources associated to the closed line (unless
 * shared with other lines).
