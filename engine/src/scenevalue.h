/**
 * SceneValue is a helper class used to store individual channel TARGET values
 * for Scene functions. Each channel that is taking part in a scene is
 * represented with a SceneValue.
 *
 * A SceneValue consists of a fixture, channel and value. Fixture tells, which
 * fixture a particular value corresponds to, channel contains the particular
 * channel number from the fixture and, value tells the exact target value for
 * that channel. Channel numbers are not absolute DMX channels because the
 * fixture address can be changed at any time. Instead, channel number tells
 * the relative channel number, respective to fixture address.
 *
 * For example:
 * Let's say we have a SceneValue with channel = 5, value = 127 and, the
 * fixture assigned to the SceneValue is at DMX address 100. Thus, the
 * SceneValue represents value 127 for absolute DMX channel 105. If the address
 * of the fixture is changed, the SceneValue doesn't need to be touched at all.
