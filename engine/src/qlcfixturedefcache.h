/**
 * QLCFixtureDefCache is a cache of fixture definitions that are currently
 * available to the application. Application can get a list of available
 * manufacturer names with QLCFixturedefCache::manufacturers() and subsequently
 * all models for a particular manufacturer with QLCFixtureDefCache::models().
 *
 * The internal structure is a two-tier map (m_models), with the first tier
 * containing manufacturer names as the keys for the first map. The value of
 * each key is another map (the second-tier) whose keys are model names. The
 * value for each model name entry in the second-tier map is the actual
 * QLCFixtureDef instance.
 *
 * Multiple manufacturer & model combinations are discarded.
 *
 * Because this component is meant to be used only on the application side,
 * the returned fixture definitions are const, preventing any modifications to
 * the definitions. Modifying the definitions would also screw up the mapping
 * since they are made only during addFixtureDef() based on the definitions'
 * manufacturer() & model() data.
