<H1>Input Profiles Howto</H1>

<P>
This howto document tells you how to associate input profiles to input universes
and how to edit these profiles. You should first read the
<A HREF="file:howto-input-output-mapping.html">howto on input/output mapping</A> so that you
can access the input/output manager and know how to edit input universes.
</P>

<H2>Input Profile Manager</H2>

<P>
To access the Input/Output Manager, just click on the tab with the <img src="qrc:/input_output.png" width=32> icon
placed on the bottom of the QLC+ main screen.<br>
Select the desired universe on the left part of the screen and then click the
<u>Profile</u> tab places beside the <u>Mapping</u> tab on the top right part of the screen.
</P>

<H2>Profile assignment</H2>

<P>
You will see a list of available input profile definitions, with a check mark
on <u>None</u>. This means that the current universe doesn't have a profile
assigned yet. To assign a profile to the universe, simply place a check mark
on one of the available profiles by clicking on the empty check box. Only one
profile can be assigned to one universe at a time, so the check mark will
actually <u>move</u> from its previous position to the item that you have
selected.
</P>

<H2>Add/Edit a Profile</H2>

<P>
It is probable that your input profile is not on the list and you need to create
one of your own.
</P>

<P>
<B>Click the <IMG SRC="qrc:/edit_add.png"> create new input profile button
to start making a profile definition for your input profile. Alternatively, you
can edit any existing profile by selecting the appropriate item and clicking
the <IMG SRC="qrc:/edit.png"> edit button. The procedure is exactly the
same in both cases from now on.</B>
</P>

<H2>Input Profile Editor</H2>

<P>
A dialog is opened with entry fields for <u>Manufacturer</u>, <u>Model</u> and <u>Type</u>.
</P>

<P>
<B>Enter the profile's manufacturer, the model and the input type to these fields and 
then click the <u>Channels</u> tab to edit the profile's channels.</B>
</P>

<P>
Now you have two choices for adding channel definitions: <u>Manual</u> and
<u>Automatic</u>:
</P>
<HR>
<P>
<IMG SRC="qrc:/edit_add.png" ALIGN="absmiddle"> Click the add button to
enter individual channel information by hand for each channel.<BR>

<IMG SRC="qrc:/wizard.png" ALIGN="absmiddle"> Click the automatic wizard
button to attempt automatic channel detection. You'll receive further
instructions from QLC+. You must have an input profile assigned to the current
universe for this feature to work. Also, you must first stop the wizard to
be able to navigate away from this dialog page.
</P>
<HR>

<P>
You can edit the existing channels by selecting them and clicking the
<IMG SRC="qrc:/edit.png"> edit button. To remove selected channels, click
the <IMG SRC="qrc:/edit_remove.png"> remove button.
</P>

<P>
When you <u>add</u> or <u>edit</u> a channel, you must enter the channel number,
name and type (Slider, Knob or Button). Note that you cannot add the same
channel multiple times to one profile.
</P>

<P>
<B>When you're ready, click the OK button to accept changes and save the
input profile. If you didn't enter a manufacturer/model for the profile,
you'll be prompted to enter them before you can continue.</B>
</P>

<H2>Back to the input profile definitions panel</H2>

<P>
Now you should see the profile you just defined in the list of available input
profiles. Remember how to assign it to the current universe? Scroll up to
<u>Profile assignment</u> if you don't.
</P>

<P>
To remove any existing input profiles, click the
<IMG SRC="qrc:/edit_remove.png"> remove button. Note that some profiles are
so-called <u>system profiles</u> and cannot be removed unless you're the
administrator.
</P>

<P>
That's all !<br>
Now you can start using your preferred profile. When assigining 
an input channel to a QLC+ element (like Virtual Console sliders, channel groups, etc..)
you will see that your Input profile mapping will be used.
