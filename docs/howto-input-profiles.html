<H1>Input Profiles Howto</H1>

<P>
This howto document tells you how to associate input profiles to input universes
and how to edit these profiles. You should first read the
<A HREF="file:howto-input-output-mapping.html">howto on input/output mapping</A> so that you
can access the input/output manager and know how to edit input universes.
</P>

<H2>Input Profile Manager</H2>

<P>
To access the Input/Output Manager, just click on the tab with the <img src="qrc:/input_output.png" width=32> icon
placed on the bottom of the QLC+ main screen.<br>
Select the desired universe on the left part of the screen and then click the
<u>Profile</u> tab placed beside the <u>Mapping</u> tab on the top right part of the screen.
</P>

<H2>Profile assignment</H2>

<P>
You will see a list of available input profile definitions, with a check mark
on <u>None</u>. This means that the current universe doesn't have a profile
assigned yet. To assign a profile to the universe, simply place a check mark
on one of the available profiles by clicking on the empty check box. Only one
profile can be assigned to one universe at a time, so the check mark will
actually <u>move</u> from its previous position to the item that you have just
selected.
</P>

<P>
<B>KORG nanoPAD: </B>For unknown reasons, the nanoPAD factory defaults don't map the X Axis of the pad area.
To have it fully working with QLC+, please download the KORG utility (Windows and OSX only) from 
<A HREF="http://www.korg.com/SupportPage.aspx?productid=415">here</A> and set the X Axis to CC2 (Control Change #2).
</P>

<H2>Add/Edit a Profile</H2>

<P>
It is probable that your input profile is not on the list and you need to create
one of your own.
</P>

<P>
<B>Click the <IMG SRC="qrc:/edit_add.png"> create new input profile button
to start making a profile definition for your input profile. Alternatively, you
can edit any existing profile by selecting the appropriate item and clicking
the <IMG SRC="qrc:/edit.png"> edit button. The procedure is exactly the
same in both cases from now on.</B>
</P>

<H2>Input Profile Editor</H2>

<P>
A dialog is opened with entry fields for <u>Manufacturer</u>, <u>Model</u> and <u>Type</u>.
</P>

<P>
<B>Enter the profile's manufacturer, the model and the input type to these fields and 
then click the <u>Channels</u> tab to edit the profile's channels.</B>
</P>

<P>
Now you have two choices for adding channel definitions: <u>Manual</u> and <u>Automatic</u>:
</P>
<HR>
<P>
<H3>Manual mode</H3>
<P>
<IMG SRC="qrc:/edit_add.png" ALIGN="absmiddle"> Click the add button to
enter individual channel information by hand for each channel.<BR>
<IMG SRC="qrc:/edit_remove.png"> Click to remove an existing channel<br>
</P>

<H3>Automatic mode</H3>
<P>
<IMG SRC="qrc:/wizard.png" ALIGN="absmiddle"> Click the automatic wizard
button to attempt automatic channel detection. You'll receive further
instructions from QLC+. You must have an 
<A HREF="file:howto-input-output-mapping.html">input plugin</A> assigned to the current
universe for this feature to work. Also, you must first stop the wizard to
be able to navigate away from this dialog page.
</P>
<HR>

<H3>Channel properties</H3>
<P>
When you add <IMG SRC="qrc:/edit_add.png" ALIGN="absmiddle"> or 
edit <IMG SRC="qrc:/edit.png" ALIGN="absmiddle"> a channel, a small window
will be displayed, asking you to fill or change some parameters:
<ul>
 <li><b>Number</b>: The channel number. Since QLC+ supports a wide variety of
     input plugins, the channel number might not be intuitive, so only edit this if
     you know what you're doing.
 </li>
 <li><b>Name</b>: The channel name. This is an arbitrary string to indicate 
     the purpose of a channel.
 </li>
 <li><b>Type</b>: The channel type. This can be: 
   <IMG SRC="qrc:/slider.png" ALIGN="absmiddle">Slider, 
   <IMG SRC="qrc:/knob.png" ALIGN="absmiddle">Knob,
   <IMG SRC="qrc:/button.png" ALIGN="absmiddle">Button<BR>
   Other types:  
   <IMG SRC="qrc:/back.png" ALIGN="absmiddle">Previous page,
   <IMG SRC="qrc:/forward.png" ALIGN="absmiddle">Next Page,
   <IMG SRC="qrc:/star.png" ALIGN="absmiddle">Set Page were used for Multipage frames, but are not used now.
 </li>
</ul>
<BR>
<b>Note that you cannot add the same channel multiple times to one profile.</b>
</P>

<H2>Back to the input profile definitions panel</H2>

<P>
When you're done with channels mapping, click the OK button to accept changes and save the
input profile. If you didn't enter a manufacturer/model for the profile,
you'll be prompted to enter them before you can continue.<br>

Now you should see the profile you just defined in the list of available input
profiles. Remember how to assign it to the current universe? Scroll up to
<u>Profile assignment</u> if you don't.
</P>

<P>
To remove any existing input profiles, click the
<IMG SRC="qrc:/edit_remove.png"> remove button. Note that some profiles are
so-called <u>system profiles</u> and cannot be removed unless you're the
administrator.
</P>

<P>
That's all !<br>
Now you can start using your preferred profile. When assigining 
an input channel to a QLC+ element (like Virtual Console sliders, channel groups, etc..)
you will see that your Input profile mapping will be used.
</P>
