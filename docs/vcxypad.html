<P>
An XY Pad is for manually controlling the <B>pan</B> and <B>tilt</B> channels
of intelligent lighting fixtures, namely scanners and moving heads. The pad is
a resizable canvas with a handle and two sliders that you can grab to obtain direct access to
the attached fixtures' mirror/head position.<BR />

<H3>Controls</H3>

<TABLE BORDER=1 class="qlcTable">
 <TR>
  <TD>
   <B>(1) Main area</B>
  </TD>
  <TD>
   This is the area where the movement occurs.
  </TD>
 </TR>
 <TR>
  <TD>
   <B>(2) Handle</B>
  </TD>
  <TD>
   The gray point is the handle. You can move it either with the mouse or with the keyboard.
  </TD>
 </TR> 
 <TR>
  <TD>
   <B>(3) Range sliders</B>
  </TD>
  <TD>
   These sliders limit the working area.
  </TD>
 </TR>
 <TR>
  <TD>
   <B>(4) Value sliders</B>
  </TD>
  <TD>
   These sliders can be used to change value in one axis only.
  </TD>
 </TR>

  <TD>
   <B>(5) XY Pad name</B>
  </TD>
  <TD>
   The name can be changed in properties, see below.

 <TR>
  <TD>
   <B>(6) DMX Coordinates</B>
  </TD>
  <TD>
   This part displays current DMX coordinates in format (Pan course.Pan fine : Tilt course.Tilt fine).
  </TD>
 </TR>
 <TR>
  <TD>
   <B>(7) Horizontal and vertical angle</B>
  </TD>
  <TD>
    If the fixtures controlled have proper pan and tilt range filled in in their definitions, and the range is same for all fixtures,
    then this field will compute angle from DMX coordinates.<BR />
    0&deg; is in the middle of the range (DMX value 127.127). For example, if pan range for a fixture is 540&deg;,
    the displayed angle will be between -270&deg; and 270&deg;.<BR />
    Note: this may not work properly, when a fixture has limited axis range in configuration, or reversed axis.
  </TD>
 </TR>
</TABLE>
<H3>Range limiting</H3>

<P>Starting from QLC+ version 4.5.0, two more sliders -- <B>(3)</B> in the picture above -- have been introduced to give you
the opportunity to set a working range window in which your moving heads will operate.<BR>
Note that from the GUI the movement of the handles will be limited to the green window area,
while with an external controller all the values will be scaled to the window, so
you will be able to have more sensitivity in the control your fixtures.
</P>
<IMG SRC="file:images/xypad2.png" />

<P>In addition, it is possible to set limits for individual fixtures in the properties dialog, see Configuration section. This setting maps
the whole range of the area (the grey area) to the sub specified range.</P>

<P>Example: set fixture X Axis (=pan) mininum to 20% (DMX value 51), maximum to 80% (DMX value 204). When the handle is at the left edge (value 0),
actual DMX output is 51. Similarly, handle at the right edge will output 204 (=80%). For values in between, DMX output is scaled proportionally.

<P>It is possible to have both limits enabled (using the range sliders and limits per fixtures).<P>

<H3>External input configuration (Input Tab)</H3>

<P>
You can attach an external input channel from an input device (like a
tablet) to XY pads so that you don't always have to use the mouse to control
your fixtures.
<UL>
  <LI>Input universe: The input universe that you wish to get input data for
    the XY pad.</LI>
    <LI>Input channel: The individual input channel within the selected input
    universe that you wish to use for controlling the XY pad.</LI>
    <LI>Auto Detect: When toggled, you can just move/press a button/slider/knob
    on your external input hardware and it will be automatically assigned to the
    XY pad. The latest combination is shown on the text boxes when QLC+ receives
    input data. If you don't see anything in the boxes, your input connection
    might have a problem that you need to fix first.<br>
    <b>Hint:</b> When assigning a XY pad from OSC, you need to click the
    "Tilt / Vertical axis" auto detect button, otherwise the X and Y axes will
    be swapped.
