<H1>Virtual Console XY Pad</H1>
<IMG SRC="qrc:/xypad.png" ALIGN="absmiddle">
<P>
An XY Pad is for manually controlling the <B>pan</B> and <B>tilt</B> channels
of intelligent lighting fixtures, namely scanners and moving heads. The pad is
a resizable canvas with a handle and two sliders that you can grab to obtain direct access to
the attached fixtures' mirror/head position.<BR>
Starting from QLC+ version 4.5.0, two more sliders have been introduced to give you
the possiblity to set a working range window where your moving heads will operate.<BR>
Note that from the GUI the handles will be bound into the green window area,
while with an external controller all the values will be scaled to the window, so
you will be able to have more sensitivity to control your fixtures.

<H3>External input configuration (Input Tab)</H3>

<P>
You can attach an external input channel from an input device (like a
tablet) to XY pads so that you don't always have to use the mouse to control
your fixtures.
<UL>
  <LI>Input universe: The input universe that you wish to get input data to
    the XY pad.</LI>
    <LI>Input channel: The individual input channel within the selected input
    universe that you wish to use for controlling the XY pad.</LI>
    <LI>Auto Detect: When toggled, you can just move/press a button/slider/knob
    on your external input hardware and it will be automatically assigned to the
    XY pad. The latest combination is shown on the text boxes when QLC+ receives
    input data. If you don't see anything in the boxes, your input connection
    might have a problem that you need to fix first.<br>
    <b>Hint:</b> When assigning a XY pad from OSC, you need to click the
    "Tilt / Vertical axis" auto detect button, otherwise the X/Y axis will
    result inverted.
