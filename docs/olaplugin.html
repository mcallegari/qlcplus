<H1>OLA output plugin</H1>

<H1>Introduction</H1>
<P>
The OLA plugin allows direct communication between QLC+ and the 
<a href="http://www.opendmx.net/index.php/Open_Lighting_Architecture">OLA framework</a> on the same machine.
</P>

<H1>Requirements</H1>

<P>
The OLA plugin requires OLA to be installed on the system.<br>
Since OLA doesn't run on Windows, only Linux and OSX users can benefit from this plugin.<br>
Information on how to download and install OLA can be found <a href="http://opendmx.net/index.php/Download_%26_Install_OLA">here</a>.<br>
QLC+ needs the OLA server to be running to be able to communicate with the OLA framework. 
This can be done either manually by starting up "olad" from a terminal or in the configuration panel
by ticking "Run standalone OLA daemon".
</P>

<H1>Configuration</H1>

<P>
When pressing the configuration button over a OLA output line, a small popup window will appear
showing the basic information of how QLC+ outputs are mapped against OLA universes.<br>
On the bottom, a check button will allow you to force the OLA server startup.
</P>

<H1>OLA Setup</H1>

<P>
When you have made sure that everything is working in QLC+ and have checked how the universes are mapped, you can setup OLA
to output the signal received from QLC+ to a DMX device, either USB or over the network.<br>
Here's an <a href="http://www.opendmx.net/index.php/Using_OLA">introduction of OLA usage</a>.<br>
Basically you need to open a web browser, connect to <a href="http://localhost:9090">http://localhost:9090</a> or 
<a href="http://127.0.0.1:9090">http://127.0.0.1:9090</a> and add a universe that has the same number mapped in QLC+ and
select the desired output line.
