<P>
Speed dials are meant for adjusting the speed of a set of functions from virtual console,
much like bus-mode sliders in the previous versions of QLC+. While the bus concept relied on
assigning functions and a slider to the same bus, the speed dial's method is a simpler and
more straightforward one: The user directly selects a set of functions whose speed properties are
controlled with the dial, thus removing the need for buses in the middle.
</P>

<H3>Operation</H3>

<P>
The speed dial itself looks and works just the same as the speed dials in various function
editors: There is a <B>big dial</B> in the middle that increases the time when rotated clockwise
and decreases it when rotated counter-clockwise. The plus
<IMG SRC="qrc:/edit_add.png" HEIGHT="16"/> and minus
<IMG SRC="qrc:/edit_remove.png" HEIGHT="16"/> buttons are an alternative way of adjusting the speed.
</P>

<P>
The <B>current time</B> value is displayed in four parts. When any of these fields is clicked,
the dial and the plus/minus buttons will increase/decrease that unit of time. The mouse
wheel can also be used instead of the dial/buttons and the fields also accept values entered
on the numeric keypad.
<LI><B>h</B>: Hours</LI>
<LI><B>m</B>: Minutes</LI>
<LI><B>s</B>: Seconds</LI>
<LI><B>.xx</B>: Centiseconds (100ths of a second)</LI>
</P>

<P>
Clicking the <B>infinite</B> button disables all of the dial's controls and sets the
currently adjusted functions' speed to infinity. For example, with a 
<A HREF="file:concept.html#Chaser">Chaser</A>, an infinite duration means that it will never
switch to the next step unless manually instructed to (see <A HREF="file:vccuelist.html">Cue List</A>).
</P>

<P>
The <B>tap</B> button can be used to match the time to a beat. 
The elapsed time between clicks is measured and this time is set for the controlled functions, just as if the dial
had been adjusted to that particular time.
</P>

<P>For cuelists/chasers and RGB Matrices, the tap button advances things to next step/position when
speed dial is set to adjust duration. The tapped tempo must be more than 1/4 of the original duration.
</P>

<H3>Configuration</H3>
<P>
Speed dials can be configured with the properties
<IMG SRC="qrc:/edit.png" ALIGN="bottom"> button found in the toolbar or
by double clicking the speed dial itself.
