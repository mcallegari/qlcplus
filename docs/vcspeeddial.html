<H1>Virtual Console Speed Dial</H1>
<IMG SRC="qrc:/knob.png" ALIGN="absmiddle">
<P>
Speed dials are meant for adjusting the speed of a set of functions from virtual console,
much like bus-mode sliders in the previous versions of QLC+. While the bus concept relied on
assigning functions and a slider to the same bus, the speed dial's method is a simpler and
more straightforward one: User directly selects a set of functions whose speed properties are
controlled with the dial, thus removing the need for buses in the middle.
</P>

<H3>Operation</H3>

<P>
The speed dial itself looks and works just the same as the speed dials in various function
editors: There is a <B>big dial</B> in the middle that increases the time when rotated clockwise
and respectively, decreases it when rotated counter-clockwise. The plus
<IMG SRC="qrc:/edit_add.png" HEIGHT="16"/> and minus
<IMG SRC="qrc:/edit_remove.png" HEIGHT="16"/> buttons perform the same thing.
</P>

<P>
The <B>current time</B> value is displayed in four parts. When any of these fields is clicked,
the dial and the plus/minus buttons will increase/decrease that part of the time. The mouse
wheel can also be used in place of the dial/buttons and the fields accept also values written
on the numeric keypad.
<LI><B>h</B>: Hours</LI>
<LI><B>m</B>: Minutes</LI>
<LI><B>s</B>: Seconds</LI>
<LI><B>.xx</B>: Centiseconds (100ths of a second)</LI>
</P>

<P>
Clicking the <B>infinite</B> button disables all of the dial's controls and sets the
currently adjusted functions' speed to infinity. For example, to a 
<A HREF="file:concept.html#Chaser">Chaser</A>, an infinite duration means that it will never
switch to the next step unless manually instructed to (see <A HREF="file:vccuelist.html">Cue List</A>).
</P>

<P>
The <B>tap</B> button can be used to adjust the time to a beat. Practically the dial measures
the elapsed time between clicks and sets this time to the controlled functions as if the dial
was adjusted accordingly.
</P>

<H3>Configuration</H3>
<P>
Speed dials can be configured with the properties

by double clicking the speed dial itself.
