<P>
The Show Manager has been introduced in QLC+ starting from version 4.0.0, after forking the original
QLC code on November 5th, 2012.<br>
<br>
This feature is meant to give users the possibility of setting up a time driven show in a friendly and
completely graphical way.<br>
The graphic interface shows a multitrack view, typical of audio sequencers or video editing softwares,
and with it users are allowed to place QLC+ <A HREF="file:concept.html#Functions">Functions</A> at the desired
place and time in the view.<br>
Show Manager gives a lot of flexibility during a <A HREF="file:concept.html#Show">Show</a> creation thanks 
to its visual-oriented approach. Once understood the basic elements, it is very easy to create, move or edit 
the existing functions and improve a Show by adding new tracks to it.<br>
<br>
Typical use cases of Shows are those gigs where a band plays songs following a metronome and the light show has
always to be the same, following the music.<br>
Another case are visual entertainment shows, where dancers or singers follow some music and lights create
the atmosphere at the right time.<br>
<br>
The Show Manager drives users to make large use of the Sequence function. Here's the explanation
of the difference between a Chaser and a Sequence.<br>
</P>

<H2>Sequences vs Chasers</H2>
<P>
Even if the <A HREF="file:concept.html#Sequence">Sequence</a> and the 
<A HREF="file:concept.html#Chaser">Chaser</a> functions have some common ground, they're not the same thing.<br>
If not done yet, you are invited to read once again their definitions in the 
<A HREF="file:concept.html">Basic Concepts &amp; Glossary</a> page of this documentation.<br>
The main differences are:
<ul>
 <li><b>Steps</b>: The steps of a Chaser can represent any QLC+ Function, while the steps
        of a Sequence represents different values of the same <A HREF="file:concept.html#Scene">Scene</a>.<br>
        In other words, a Chaser is an independent function, while a Sequence can exist only
        on top of a Scene.<br>
        The reason for this is, as mentioned before, the visual approach of the Show Manager.
        If a track of a Show is the graphical representation of a Scene, then it's more intuitive 
        to think that each Sequence created on that track is a function controlling the values of that Scene.
 </li>
 <li><b>Order</b>: Chasers can be reproduced in any order (Forward, Backward, Ping-Pong, Random) while
        in the Show Manager, Sequences are always reproduced from the beginning to the end (Forward).
        Again, this is related to the visual aspect of the Show Manager, where the playback
        has a natural time forward direction.<br>
        On the other hand, Sequences created with the Function Manager can have the 
        same order properties of Chasers.
 </li>
 <li><b>Editing</b>: The editing approach between Sequences and Chaser is different too.<br>
        Normally the workflow of a Chaser is: create a Function, then add it to the Chaser as a step.<br>
        The workflow of a Sequence is: create a Scene, create a Sequence on top of it, add steps to it.<br>
        The Sequence approach might be very effective when you design a light show if you can pre-determine
        which fixtures you're going to use. Another major advantage of Sequence editing is
        that when you create a new step, the values of the previous step are copied in the new one.
        So the user is simply required to adjust the differences between them.<br>
        If you are going to create 500 steps and they're all different, then Sequences and Chasers
        will take almost the same time to be created.<br>
 </li>
 <li><b>Synchronization</b>: another major advantage of using Sequences in a Show is that a Show
        can easily be extended (or reduced) while with a Chaser you will have a hard time to
        synchronize the new functions to the existing ones.<br>
        An example. Let's say your project controls 50 fixtures that are a mixture of moving heads, PARs and scanners.
        At some point you buy a couple of lasers and you want them to become active in existing scenes
        at precise moments in time. The Show Manager allows you to do that in a few minutes !
        You just need to add the 2 new fixtures to the project, add a track to the Shows affected by
        the change and create a few Sequences to control the lasers.<br>
        The Show Manager resume functionality will also save you a lot of time when testing the new
        changes.<br>
        With Chasers you'd probably have to deal with complex <A HREF="file:concept.html#Collection">Collections</a>
        and review the timings of a few steps before finding the right combination.
</ul>

  a window is displayed, allowing you to perform the following operations:
  <ul>
   <li>Create a new track: This creates a new empty track that will serve as a container 
       for Sequences and Audio functions.
   </li>
   <li>Import an existing Scene. This will create a new track and a 10 seconds Sequence
       with one single step representing the selected Scene.
   </li>
   <li>Import an existing Sequence: this operation scans the existing tracks and if
       it finds a track already bound to the Sequence's bound Scene, then add the
       Sequence to that track at the cursor position.<br>
       If no compatible track is found, a new track will be created and bound to the
       Sequence's bound Scene.
   </li>
   <li>Import an existing Audio: add an Audio function at the cursor position on the
       selected track. If no track is available, it will create a new one.

<H2>Just 4 steps</H2>

The Show Manager has been set up to be used quickly and easily. Basically, with just 4 steps a complete
<A HREF="file:concept.html#Show">Show</A> can be created:

<OL>
<H3><LI>Add a new Show <IMG SRC="qrc:/show.png"></LI></H3>
First of all you need to add a new Show to the view. This creates an empty multitrack view with no tracks
and no items, ready to be filled.<br>
A popup will appear asking the name to assign to the Show. It is possible to change the name afterwards with the
<A HREF="file:functionmanager.html">Function Manager</A>, using the <A HREF="file:showeditor.html">Show Editor</A> panel.

<H3><LI>Add a track <IMG SRC="qrc:/edit_add.png"></LI></H3>
When you add a track, a popup will ask you to select an existing function or to create a new one with a default name.<br>
When done, a new track will be created. All the sequences created on this track
will act only on the associated Scene, not affecting any of the other tracks.<br>
A newly created track will be set automatically as active. An active track has a green light on the left hand side.<br>
A Track can be set to mute and solo states. The mute state will exclude the track from the playback, while the solo state will
mute all the other tracks of the Show.<br>
When right clicking on a track, it is possible to move it up <IMG SRC="qrc:/up.png"> or down <IMG SRC="qrc:/down.png">
for logical ordering.<br>
Once selected, a track will display its <A HREF="file:sceneeditor.html">Scene Editor</A> on the bottom of the screen.

<H3><LI>Add a Sequence <IMG SRC="qrc:/sequence.png">  or Audio <IMG SRC="qrc:/audio.png"></LI></H3>

When a track has been activated, it is possible to add a <A HREF="file:concept.html#Sequence">Sequence</A> or
and <A HREF="file:concept.html#Audio">Audio</A> item to it.<br>
A new item will be placed at the cursor position, but it is always possible to move it to the desired time
just by dragging it along the timeline.<br>
An item cannot be moved to another track, since it is bound to the track where it has originally been created.<br>
An item can be copied <IMG SRC="qrc:/editcopy.png">, pasted <IMG SRC="qrc:/editpaste.png"> or 
deleted <IMG SRC="qrc:/editdelete.png"> with the toolbar icons. The pasted item will be placed at the current cursor position.<br>
The item background color can be changed with the toolbar icon <IMG SRC="qrc:/color.png">. The assigned color will be saved
in your project file.<br>
Once selected, a sequence will display its <A HREF="file:chasereditor.html">Chaser Editor</A> and an audio will display 
its Audio editor on the right hand side of the screen.
When right clicking an item a contextual menu will be displayed, showing the following options:
<ul>
<li>Preview: This option is available only on audio items. It will display the waveform preview for right, left or stereo channels when available</li>
<li>Align to cursor: This option will move the selected item to the cursor position</li>
</ul>
Follow step 4 to understand how to fill a Sequence<br>

<H3><LI>Add some steps <IMG SRC="qrc:/edit_add.png"></LI></H3>
Once a sequence has been created, it is now the time to add steps to it.<br>
<b>Please note</b> that the difference between a Chaser and a Sequence is that a Sequence is bound to the Track (so the Scene)
where it has been created. So, when adding a step, QLC+ will not ask to select a particular function, but will always use the
channels of the same Scene.<br>
When modifying a step hold, fade in or fade out time, you will see the sequence changing on the multitrack view,
giving an immediate feedback for aligning to other sequences or particular points in time.<br>
Fade In and Fade Out times will be displayed as diagonal lines over the sequence item on the multitrack view, while
different steps will be divided by vertical lines.<br>

</OL>
<br>
To increase the complexity of the Show, more sequences, audio and scenes can be added. Just repeat the above steps
depending on your needs.<br>

<H2>And finally...play ! <IMG SRC="qrc:/player_play.png"></H2>
When a complete show has finally been created, it can be played just by clicking on the Play icon.<br>
Playback always starts from the current cursor postion. The cursor position can be changed by clicking on the time line.
