<H1>Head Editor</H1>
<P>
The Head Editor is used to create and edit <A HREF="file:concept.html#Head">heads</A>
by picking sets of <B>Channels</B> that are dedicated to a single head (as defined by the
fixture's manufacturer). 
</P>

<H3>Controls</H3>

<P>
The controls are very simple: place a checkmark on each channel that is used ONLY by the
head you are currently editing. To add a head, see <A HREF="modeeditor.html">Mode Editor</A>.
</P>

<TABLE BORDER="1">
 <TR>
  <TD>
   <B>Channel list</B>
  </TD>
  <TD>
   Displays the list of all fixture channels available in the current mode. Channels that
   have been assigned to another head are disabled and cannot be selected because each
   channel can belong to one head at a time.
