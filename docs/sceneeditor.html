<H1>Scene Editor</H1>
<P>
The scene editor, as its name suggests, is used to edit
<A HREF="file:concept.html#Scene">Scene</A> functions. The editor is divided into
tabs; with the first, <B>General</B> tab, you control the list of fixtures 
and <A HREF="file:concept.html#Channelgroups">channel groups</A> that take part in the scene editing,
together with the Scene name.<br>
All subsequent tabs are used to control the individual channel values for each fixture
and, if defined, the channels groups values.
</P>

<H2>General Tab Controls</H2>

On the left part of the screen, are displayed the buttons to control the fixtures used in the scene<br>

<H2>Channel Groups Tabs</H2>

<P>
This tab will be displayed only if one or more channel groups are selected in the General tab.<br>
Each Channel Group will be displayed with a quick macro access button 
(<A HREF="file:concept.html#ClickAndGo">Click And Go</A> if supported), 
a label with the group value, a fader, and the name of the group.
</P>

<H2>Fixture Tabs</H2>

<P>
Each fixture is represented by its own tab that contains sliders for each of
the fixture's channels. Each channel can be enabled or disabled with a check
box on top of the channel unit. The value of each channel can be set either by
typing the value to the edit box on top of the slider or by moving the slider.
Channels that provide multiple functions such as gobos, colors, etc. have also
a button above the channel slider; this button can be used to directly select
a specific function or capability provided by that channel.<br>
<b>Hint</b>: The keyboard shortcut to move between channels values edit boxes is '<b>Tab</b>'
</P>

<H3>Channel enabled/disabled status</H3>

<P>
If a channel has not been enabled, the scene will not touch that particular
channel's value ever.
</P>

<P>
If a channel has been enabled, the scene will change that channel's value to a
value defined in the scene. This is useful, for example, when you wish to
control only the dimmer channel of a scanner fixture; you wouldn't want the
scene to touch the scanner's pan, tilt, colour or gobo channels when you just
want to fade in or fade out with the dimmer channel.
</P>
