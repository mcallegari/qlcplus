<H1>Fixture Manager</H1>
<P>
The fixture manager is the heart of QLC+'s fixture-oriented architecture. As
its name already says, you can manage  (add, remove and edit) your lighting
fixtures from the fixture manager. On the left side of the manager there is a
list that displays all of the fixtures in the current workspace. When a fixture
is selected, the right side of the window displays the details of the selected fixture.
When a <A HREF="file:concept.html#FixtureGroup">Fixture Group</A> is selected,
the right side of the window is occupied by the <A HREF="file:fixturegroupeditor.html">Fixture Group Editor</A>.

   Add new <A HREF="file:concept.html#Fixtures">Fixture</A>(s) to the workspace with
   the <A HREF="file:addeditfixtures.html">Add/Edit Fixture</A> dialog.
  </TD>
 </TR>
 <TR>
  <TD><IMG SRC="qrc:/edit_remove.png"></TD>
  <TD>
   Remove the selected fixtures from the workspace. This also removes the fixtures from ALL
   groups they have been assigned to.

 </TR>
 <TR>
  <TD><IMG SRC="qrc:/configure.png"></TD>
  <TD>
   Edit the currently selected fixture's properties with the

  </TD>
 </TR>
 <TR>
  <TD><IMG SRC="qrc:/fade.png"></TD>
  <TD>
   Opens a window to select the desired channels to exclude from fade transitions.<br>
   For example, moving head motors shouldn't be affected from Fade In/Fade Out curves.
   With this option you can exclude them to obtain the correct behaviour.<br>
   When dealing with a lot of fixtures of the same type, you might want to check 
   the "Apply changes to fixtures of the same type" check box. This can save you 
   quite a lot of time when setting up your projects for the first time.
  </TD>
 </TR> 
 <TR>
  <TD><IMG SRC="qrc:/group.png"></TD>
  <TD>
   Assign the selected fixtures to a <A HREF="file:concept.html#FixtureGroup">Fixture Group</A>

 <TR>
  <TD><IMG SRC="qrc:/ungroup.png"></TD>
