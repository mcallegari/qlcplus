<P>
The fixture manager is the heart of QLC+'s fixture-oriented architecture. As
its name already says, you can manage  (add, remove and edit) your lighting
fixtures from the fixture manager. On the left side of the manager there is a
list that displays all of the fixtures in the current workspace. When a fixture
is selected, the right side of the window displays the details of the selected fixture.
When a <A HREF="file:concept.html#FixtureGroup">Fixture Group</A> is selected,
the right side of the window is occupied by the <A HREF="file:fixturegroupeditor.html">Fixture Group Editor</A>.
