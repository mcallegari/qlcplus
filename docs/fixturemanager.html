<P>
The fixture manager is the heart of QLC+'s fixture-oriented architecture. As
its name already says, you can manage  (add, remove and edit) your lighting
fixtures from the fixture manager. On the left side of the manager there is a
list that displays all of the fixtures in the current workspace. When a fixture
is selected, the right side of the window displays the details of the selected fixture.
When a <A HREF="file:concept.html#FixtureGroup">Fixture Group</A> is selected,
the right side of the window is occupied by the <A HREF="file:fixturegroupeditor.html">Fixture Group Editor</A>.

   Opens a window to set the fixture channels properties. It mainly has two usages:
   <ul>
    <li>Select the channels to exclude from fade transitions.<br>
        For example, moving head motors shouldn't be affected from Fade In/Fade Out curves.
        With this option you can exclude them to obtain the correct behaviour.</li>
    <li>Select the channels behaviour according to the <A HREF="file:concept.html#HTP">HTP</A> and
        <A HREF="file:concept.html#LTP">LTP</A> rules. When changing the bahaviour of a channel,
        the dropdown list with highlight in red, showing evidence of the channels modified<br>
        <b>Note: Use this functionality only if you know what you're doing and fully understand
        how HTP and LTP work</b></li>
   </ul>
   When dealing with a lot of fixtures of the same type, you might want to check 
   the "Apply changes to fixtures of the same type" check box. This can save you 
   quite a lot of time when setting up your projects for the first time.
