<H1>Input/Output Mapping Howto</H1>

This howto document tells you how to patch plugins and their input/output lines
(physical input/output devices) to QLC+'s universes.

<H2>Input/Output Manager</H2>

<P>
To access the Input/Output Manager, just click on the tab with the <img src="qrc:/input_output.png" width=32> icon
placed on the bottom of the QLC+ main screen.<br>
The screen is composed in this way:<br>
<ul>
 <li>On the left side there is the list of internal universes that QLC+ can manage</li>
 <li>On the right side there is the list of devices and their mapped inputs, outputs and feedback lines that QLC+ has detected</li>
 <li>On the bottom right side there is a panel displaying brief information of the currently selected device</li>
</ul>

Every device has a checkbox whwnever an input, output or feedback line is available.<br>
Each QLC+ universe can map a single input, a single output and a single feedback line<br>
</P>

<P>
Some plugins might require configuration before they can be used so you might
not be able to see all inputs/outputs at first. The configuration button
is place next to the information panel and it is enabled if the plugin 
allows any manual setting.<br>
The button is icon is: <IMG SRC="qrc:/configure.png" width=32>
</P>


<H2>Patching</H2>

<P>
To patch a plugin's input/output line to the selected universe, you need to place
a checkmark on that particular plugin's input/output line. You can have only one
line assigned to a universe at a time, so when you check another line, the
checkmark will <u>move</u> from its previous position to the one you checked.<br>
If you don't see any line on a plugin, it means you don't have any device that QLC+
understands and you're left with the one and only (non-selectable) choice: <u>None</u>.
</P>

<P>
When an input/output line is checked, the corresponding universe information on the left side of the screen
will change and will display the new configuration set.<br>
The plugin information on the bottom right side of the screen will change as well and will give 
you the new status of the plugin line.
</P>

<H2>Input and Feedbacks</H2>

<P>
When a plugin input line is checked, it gets enabled right away, so you can perform a basic test
to double check if your hardware is working properly with QLC+.<br>
Just move a fader/knob on your external device, and if everything works fine, you will see a 
<IMG SRC="qrc:/input.png" width=32> icon appearing beside the corresponding universe
on the left side of the screen.
</P>

<P>
If your input device supports a return channel, QLC+ can send a visual/mechanical feedback 
to it. Devices such as Behringer BCF2000 support this feature.<br>
At the moment feedbacks are supported only through MIDI.
</P>
