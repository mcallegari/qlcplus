<P>
The DMX Dump functionality allows you to save the current DMX values that are sent to the ouput universes
in a particular moment. Basically it makes a "screenshot" of DMX channels and saves them for a later use.<br>
DMX Dump can save values to a new <A HREF="file:concept.html#Scene">Scene</A> and also add the newly created 
Scene into an existing <A HREF="file:concept.html#Chaser">Chaser</A>.<br><br>

Please note that:
<ul>
 <li>Selected Channels/Chasers will be remembered when re-opening this window</li>
 <li>The DMX values saved are taken before the Grand Master</li>
</ul>
When opening the DMX Dump window, the following options will appear:<br>

<TABLE BORDER="1">
 <TR>
  <TD><b>Scene name</b></TD>
  <TD>
   Defines the name that the Scene that will be created will have. If none specified, a default 
   name like "New Scene From Live" and a numeric identification will be set for fast use of this functionality.
  </TD>
 </TR>
 <TR>
  <TD><B>Dump all channels</B></TD>
  <TD>
   If this option is selected, QLC+ will dump all the channels of all the universes and all the fixtures.
   To inform the user about what this option will do, a report in the form of (Universes, Fixtures, Channels) 
   will be displayed.
  </TD>
 </TR>
 <TR>
  <TD><B>Dump selected channels</B></TD>
  <TD>
   If this option is selected, the panel below will be activated, allowing you to choose exactly the channels
   that you need to be saved into a Scene. They're organized in a tree by Universes and Fixtures.
  </TD>
 </TR>
 <TR>
  <TD>
   <B>Add to Chaser</B>
  </TD>
  <TD>
   The chasers panel is filled with all the chasers present when DMX Dump window is openend. Each Chaser
   has a checkbox that, if checked, will tell QLC+ to add the newly created Scene to the selected chasers.<br>
   This feature is nice when using <A HREF="file:vccuelist.html">Cue Lists</A> in the 
   <A HREF="file:virtualconsole.html">Virtual Console</A> panel. In this case, the newly created Scene will appear
   in the Cue List for immediate use during a live performance.
  </TD>
 </TR>
 <TR>
  <TD><B>Dump only non-zero values</B></TD>
  <TD>
   This option will tell QLC+ to save only the channels with values <b>not</b> equal to zero.<br>
   If you know what you're doing, this could save project space and avoid channels conflicts with other
   Virtual Console widgets.
  </TD>
 </TR>
