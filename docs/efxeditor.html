<H1>EFX Editor</H1>
<P>
The EFX editor, as its name suggests, is used to edit
<A HREF="file:concept.html#EFX">EFX</A> functions. The view is split into two tabs:
</P>
<UL>
 <LI><B>General</B> tab is for selecting <A HREF="file:concept.html#Fixtures">Fixtures</A>, speed and fixture order.</LI>
 <LI><B>Movement</B> tab is for selecting details on how the fixtures should move their beams.</LI>
</UL>

<A NAME="efx-intensity" />
<P><B>Note</B>: when EFX is started, it will set the intensity of all included fixtures to the preset value.
That usually means it set them full on. If you don't want this, just set the preset intensity to something
lower, perhaps 0. That way you can control intensity of the fixture using other means like VC sliders for
the intensity/dimmer channels, or by another chaser.
