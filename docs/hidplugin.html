<H1>HID plugin</H1>

<H1>1.Introduction</H1>
<P>
The HID plugin supports the <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_interface_device">HID system</A> on Windows and Linux.<br>
HID is a generic way of mapping input/output devices such as joysticks, touchpads, keyboards, mice, etc.<br>
The QLC+ HID plugin aims to support only joysticks and the FX5 USB DMX adapter.
</P>

<H1>2.Requirements</H1>
<P>
No special requirement is needed for this plugin. Just make sure your operating system is actually
recognizing the device you're going to use. On Linux you might need some kernel modules and on Windows
a driver provided by the device manufacturer.

QLC+ tries to detect the specific joystick functionalities, such as axes and buttons,
as individual channels that can be mapped to your Virtual Console widgets

<P>
The <A HREF="http://www.fx5.de/">FX5 USB DMX</A> adapter is supported either for output and input
