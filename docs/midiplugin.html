<H1>Introduction</H1>
<P>
This plugin gives input/output support for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIDI">MIDI protocol</a>
and leave the user the freedom to control typical parameters like channels, Program Change, Control Change.<br>

The MIDI plugin can be quite powerful used in combination with MIDI devices such as keyboards, MIDI controllers 
(like Behringer BCF2000 or KORG nanoKONTROL) or software audio sequencer like Cubase or Ardour 3.<br>
The usage can vary from fader-to-fader controlling (the BCF2000 case) to sequence triggering for synchronized
shows (metronome controlled gigs using an audio sequencer)
</P>

<H1>Configuration</H1>

<P>
When clicking on the configuration button, a window will appear, showing all the MIDI input and output lines
detected.<br>
Each line has two options that can be changed depending on your needs:
<ul>
 <li><b>MIDI Channel</b>: This is the channel where QLC+ will receive or send data through the MIDI system. MIDI channels can go
     from 1 to 16. The special "1-16" channel will tell QLC+ to receive or send data on any MIDI channel.
 </li>
 <li><b>Mode</b>: This is the MIDI mode that QLC+ will use to receive/send data through the MIDI system. 
     This parameter can assume two possible values:
     <ul>
      <li><b>Note velocity</b>: in this mode, QLC+ will receive/send data using MIDI notes velocity. MIDI notes can go from 21 (A0) to 108 (C8) and 
          each note can have a velocity going from 0 to 127, which will be doubled inside QLC+ to fit the DMX range (0-255).
      </li>
      <li><b>Control Change</b>: this is one of the MIDI protocol messages (like Program Change) frequently used by MIDI controllers.
      Each device should list the supported CC messages in its user manual, so please consult it before using this mode. CC range can go
      from 0 to 127 and can carry values from 0 to 127, which will be doubled inside QLC+ to fit the DMX range (0-255).
      </li>
     </ul>
 </li>
</ul>
</P>

<H1>Feedbacks</H1>

<P>
At the moment, the MIDI plugin is the only one supporting feedbacks. When QLC+ detects a MIDI device with an output line, it will
enable the feedback check box in the <A HREF="file:howto-input-output-mapping.html">Input/Output panel</A>. Please note that output
and feedbacks are exclusive, so they cannot be used both at the same time.<br>
If your MIDI device supports a return channel, QLC+ can send a visual/mechanical feedback to it. Devices such as Behringer BCF2000 support this feature.
This is very useful during live shows, to have an immediate feeling of the current state of faders controlled by QLC+.<br><br>

A small trick that can be achieved with QLC+, is to use feedbacks as a generic MIDI output line to trigger external controllers/sequencers.<br>
Let's make some examples:
<ul>
 <li>Input: <b>OSC</b> ---> Output: <b>DMX USB</b> --> Feedback: <b>MIDI</b></li>
 <li>Input: <b>Enttec Wing</b> --> Output: <b>ArtNet</b> --> Feedback: <b>MIDI</b></li>
</ul>
