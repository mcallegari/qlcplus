<H1>Input Mapping Howto</H1>

This howto document tells you how to patch input plugins and their input lines
(physical input devices) to QLC's internal input universes.

<H1>Input Manager</H1>

<P>
<B>Click the <u>Inputs</u> item from the main window's <u>Manager</u> menu.</B>
</P>

<P>
A window is opened with the title <u>"Output Manager"</u>. There's a list of
internal input universes, plugins and input lines, with a toolbar on top of
the list with just one button:

Each of these internal universes can have one input plugin and one input line
from that plugin assigned to them. In other words, the input control data
that you create with an external input device (like a slider board) is first
caught thru some plugin's input line, which is then sent thru the plugin to
the main QLC application. This data is then made available thru an input
universe that you can use to connect to from various virtual console elements
and editors. The flow of data is basically just the opposite compared to 
<A HREF="howto-output-mapping.html">Output Mapping</A>.
</P>

<P>
Each universe can also have a special <u>Input Device</u>, which basically
tells you, what kinds of controls your input hardware contains. For example,
the <u>Behringer BCF 2000</u> slider board contains multiple sliders, knobs
and buttons that are seen just dumb channels by QLC. An <u>Input Device</u>
can tell you, which channel is which slider, button and knob so you don't
have to memorize them. You could think of an input device as an input-side
equivalent to an output-side

definition</A>.
</P>

<P>
One of these universes is also set to act as the <u>Default editor universe</u>.
This ability is used by scene editor and fixture console to get direct input
from your slider board and ease channel value setting.

<H2>Mapping Properties</H2>

<P>
<B>Select <u>universe 1</u> and then click the
<IMG SRC="qrc:/edit.png" ALIGN="absmiddle"> edit button to edit the first
universe's mapping properties.</B>
</P>

<P>
A dialog opens with a list of available plugins. If you open these plugin
nodes (click the little "+" sign) you can see a list of physical input lines
that each plugin provides.
</P>

<P>
Below the list is a text field that displays some information on the selected
plugin and/or input line that you have currently selected.
</P>

<P>
Right next to the text field is a
<IMG SRC="qrc:/configure.png"> configuration button that
lets you access a dialog with which you can configure the selected plugin.
Each plugin's configuration window differs slightly from one another because
different plugins require different kinds of options and it has been left to
the plugin developers to decide the configuration dialog layout. Note that not
all plugins necessarily provide this option.
</P>

<P>
Some plugins might require configuration before they can be used so you might
not be able to see all inputs at first.
</P>

<P>
You can also set the currently selected universe to act as the <u>Default
editor universe</u>. Since one of the universes is always the editor, you
cannot uncheck the option.
</P>

<H2>Patching</H2>

<P>
To patch a plugin's input line to the selected universe, you need to place
a checkmark on that particular plugin's input line. You can have only one
line assigned to a universe at a time, so when you check another line, the
checkmark will <u>move</u> from its previous position to the one you checked.
If you can't see any input lines, you don't have any input devices that QLC
understands and you're left with the one and only choice: <u>None</u>.
</P>

<P>
<B>Place the checkmark on one of the available input options and click OK
to close the dialog and accept the mapping.</B>
</P>

<H2>Back in the Input Manager</H2>

<P>
Now you should see the input device mapping in the <u>Input Manager</u>. If
you assigned a valid input device to the universe, wiggling its controls will
now flash a small icon <IMG SRC="qrc:/input.png" height="14"> in the universe
column to show that QLC receives input data from that device.
