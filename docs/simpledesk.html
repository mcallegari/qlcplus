<H1><IMG SRC="qrc:/slidermatrix.png" ALIGN="absmiddle"> Simple Desk</H1>

<P>
The simple desk emulates a typical lighting console that is able to control a full
512-channel DMX universe with a multiple cue stacks operated with playback sliders.<BR>
Simple desk is divided into two main areas: <B>channels</B> (top area) and <B>cues</B> (bottom area).<BR>
The channels area reflects exactly the current status of each DMX channel of each universe. 
If channels are controlled with no project loaded, users have a completely manual control of them.<BR>
When a project is loaded, instead, moving a Simple desk channel will override any other QLC+ 
function trying to control that channel. A visual indication will turn the channel background
to red, informing the user that Simple desk now has the total control of it.<BR>
This is very useful in some live circumstances where a running function needs some manual adjustment.<BR>
To "disengage" Simple desk from overriding channels, just click on the reset button.
Resetting channels will either bring them back to zero or to the value previously set by a function.<BR><BR>
Cues operates separately from other QLC+ components. For example, cues within the cue stack are 
not visible in the <A HREF="file:functionmanager.html">Function Manager</A>
and <A HREF="file:concept.html#Scene">Scenes</A> are not visible in the cue stack.
</P>

<H1>Controls - Universe</H1>

<P>
The universe box contains the sliders that are used to control individual DMX channels
in the first DMX universe. Since 512 sliders cannot fit nicely on the screen at the same
time, they have been divided into pages. By default, each page contains 32 sliders but
that can be <A HREF="#Tuning">tuned</A>.

<H1>Controls - Playback</H1>

<P>
The playback box contains a bunch of playback sliders each of which may contain a cue stack.
The playbacks can be used to "play back" the contents of their cue stacks and they can also
be used to adjust their overall intensity of the cue.

<TABLE BORDER=1 class="qlcTable">

  <TD>Adjust the intensity of playback's cue stack. When the slider is drawn all the way to zero,
      the cue stack is stopped. Any value above zero will start replaying the playbacks'
      cue stack.</TD>

      <P>The Fade In speed, Fade Out speed and Duration as well as the name of individual cues
      can be adjusted with the speed dials that are displayed in a separate tool window. You
      can also select multiple cues to adjust their speeds all at the same time, but then the DMX sliders
      are disabled to prevent you from accidentally overwriting all cue contents with the same
      values.</P></TD>
