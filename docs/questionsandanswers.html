  <TD>QLC+ cannot detect my USB device</TD>
 </TR>
 <TR>
  <TD><H2>A:</H2></TD>
  <TD>QLC+ supports a wide variety of USB devices. First of all you should check if the physical connection
      is OK. Usually a LED on your device should indicate if it is powered up and working correctly.<BR>
      If you are using Windows and your device is manufactured by Peperoni or Velleman, please read the information on how to get
      them working on these help pages. For licensing issues they both need an extra DLL file to work.
      Please check <A HREF="peperonioutput.html">Peperoni output plugin</A> or <A HREF="vellemanoutput.html">Velleman output plugin</A><BR>
      If you're using Linux, please check if your distribution detected the device when plugged in. Basically, the 
      "<CODE>dmesg</CODE>" command should tell you something.

  <TD><H2>Q:</H2></TD>
  <TD>I just upgraded my Mac to OSX Mavericks but my Open USB DMX adapter doesn't work anymore.</TD>
 </TR>
 <TR>
  <TD><H2>A:</H2></TD>
  <TD>The problem is in a new Apple USB driver. The procedure to disable it follows below.<br>
      <B>Please note that this can compromise the behaviour of other USB devices, so do it only 
      if you know what you're doing! </B><br>
      From a terminal type the following commands:<br>
      <PRE>
      cd /System/Library/Extensions/IOUSBFamily.kext/Contents/PlugIns
      sudo mv AppleUSBFTDI.kext AppleUSBFTDI.disabled
      sudo touch /System/Library/Extensions

  <TD><H2>Q:</H2></TD>
  <TD>Where is the QLC+ user folder located in my system ?</TD>
 </TR>
 <TR>
  <TD><H2>A:</H2></TD>
  <TD>The user folder is where user fixtures, input profiles, RGB scripts and MIDI templates go.<br>
      It changes depending on your operating system:<br>
      <B>Linux</B>: it is a hidden folder in your user home directory: $HOME/.qlcplus<br>
      <B>Windows</B>: it is a folder in your user (e.g. MyUser) directory: C:\Users\MyUser\QLC+<br>
      <B>OSX</B>: it is located in your user "Library" directory: $HOME/Library/Application\ Support/QLC+<br>
      You can reach any of these folders from a terminal with the 'cd' command. For example:<br>
      <PRE>cd $HOME/Library/Application\ Support/QLC+</PRE>
      Please keep in mind that fixures and input profiles found in the user folder will have precedence
      over the same files in the QLC+ system folder.<br>
