<H1>Capability Editor</H1>
<P>
With the Capability Editor you can define a value range for a certain
functionality provided by a fixture channel. For example, if values 0-15
produce a white colour capability, you might put:
<UL>
 <LI>0 to the <B>Min</B> field</LI>
 <LI>15 to the <B>Max</B> field, and</LI>
 <LI>"White" to the <B>Description</B> field</LI>
</UL>
</P>

<H3>Controls</H3>

<TABLE BORDER="1">
 <TR>
  <TD>
   <B>Min</B>
  </TD>
  <TD>
   The minimum value of the capability
  </TD>
 </TR>
 <TR>
  <TD>
   <B>Max</B>
  </TD>
  <TD>
   The maximum value of the capability
  </TD>
 </TR>
 <TR>
  <TD>
   <B>Description</B>
  </TD>
  <TD>
   The name or description of the capability. Don't be too elaborate, just a
   few words.
  </TD>
 </TR>
</TABLE>

<H3>Click & Go capability</H3>

<P>The Click & Go functionality for a channel starts from the Capability Editor.<br>
When a channels group is set to Gobo, Colour or Effect, it is possible to assign the color 
or a picture that will be displayed by Click & Go on <A HREF="file:sceneeditor.html">Scene Editor</A>, 
<A HREF="file:simpledesk.html">Simple Desk</A> and <A HREF="file:vcslider.html">Virtual Console Slider</A>.<br>
This allows a very quick visual feedback, and will avoid you to remember the meaning of each range of values.<br>
When a channel can support Click & Go, some additional controls will appear on the right side of
the Capability Editor, displaying 3 butons and a preview box. Here's the meaning of each one:</P>

<TABLE BORDER="1">
 <TR>
  <TD>Picture <B>...</B></TD>
  <TD>When clicking on this button you can select a picture for this range of values,
  to be displayed by Click & Go for visual association and quick access</TD>
 </TR>
 <TR>
  <TD>Colour <IMG SRC="qrc:/color.png"/></TD>
  <TD>When clicking on this button you can select a primary colour for this range of values.
  When a primary colour is set, the 'Second colour' button will be enabled. See below.</TD>
 </TR>
 <TR>
  <TD>Second colour <IMG SRC="qrc:/color.png"/></TD>
  <TD>When clicking on this button you can select a secondary colour for those cases 
  where a fixture supports it. For example this is quite useful for those moving heads 
  with colour wheels supporting intermediate positions.</TD>
