<H1><img src="qrc:/audioinput.png" ALIGN="absmiddle"> Virtual Console Audio Triggers</H1>
<P>
Starting from QLC+ version 4.4.0, this functionality allows you to use an audio input
source like a microphone, to add more life to your light shows.<br>

<H1>1 Introduction</H1>

When clicking on the <img src="qrc:/audioinput.png"> icon, an audio trigger widget will be
added to your Virtual Console.<br>
The widget graphics area shows the live monitoring of the captured audio, displaying
a number of spectrum bars and a volume bar.<br>
On the bottom you can see the range of frequencies analyzed by QLC+<br>

<H1>2 Configuration</H1>

When double clicking on the widget in design mode, a panel is displayed, showing a complete set of options
to tune the audio triggers functionality.<br>
The first thing you can configure is the number of spectrum bars that you want to display and that you 
will need during your live show. The accepted number is between 5 and 32.<br>
Once decided the number of bars, you can proceed to assign a functionality to each bar. There is a list
showing the following options for the volume and spectrum bars:<br><br>

<TABLE BORDER=1 class="qlcTable">
 <TR>
  <TD><B>Name</B></TD>
  <TD>Can be "Volume Bar" or a spectrum bar shown as #number (start frequency - end frequency). Example: #5 (1250Hz - 1562Hz)></TD>
 </TR>
 <TR>
  <TD><B>Type</B></TD>
  <TD>Indicates the type of functionality the bar will control. It can be:
     <UL>
      <LI><img src="qrc:/uncheck.png"> None - No functionality assigned</LI>
      <LI><img src="qrc:/intensity.png"> DMX - Controls single DMX channels</LI>
      <LI><img src="qrc:/function.png"> Function - Controls a QLC+ function</LI>
      <LI><img src="qrc:/virtualconsole.png"> VC Widget - Controls a Virtual Console widget (at the moment only buttons, sliders and tapping of speed dials)</LI>
     </UL>
  </TD>
 </TR>
 <TR>
  <TD><B>Assign</B></TD>
  <TD>When a type is selected, a button with <img src="qrc:/attach.png"> icon is displayed to allow 
  you to connect the bar to the desired functionality. Depending on which type you chose, clicking on
  this button will display the DMX channels, Functions or Virtual Console widgets selection dialogs.
  </TD>
 </TR>
 <TR>
  <TD><B>Info</B></TD>
  <TD>This column displays some additional information regarding the bar--functionality association.<br>
  Depending on the type you chose, here you will find the number of DMX channels, the function name or 
  the VC Widget name selected</TD>
 </TR>
 <TR>
  <TD><B>Disable threshold</B></TD>
  <TD>When selecting a Function or a VC Widget button, this column allows you to set a deactivation 
  threshold percentage. When the spectrum or volume bar will go below this value, the associated function/VC button
  will be stopped/deactivated.</TD>
 </TR>
 <TR>
  <TD><B>Enable threshold</B></TD>
  <TD>When selecting a Function or a VC Widget button, this column allows you to set an activation 
  threshold percentage. When the spectrum or volume bar will go above this value, the associated function/VC button
  will be started/activated.</TD>
 </TR>
 <TR>
  <TD><B>Divisor</B></TD>
  <TD>For speed dials, this will divide the taps: only every n-th tap will be actually sent to the speed dial.
  In other words, the tap happens only every n-th beat. If you want the tap every beat, enter 1, for every other beat enter 2.
  For once in a 4/4 measure, enter 4. For once in 3 4/4 measures, enter 12. Maximum is 64.
  </TD>
 </TR>
</TABLE>
</P>

<H2>DMX channels</H2>
<P>You can choose one or more channels of the currently patched fixtures. Those channels will be set proportionally 
to total volume, or volume in respective frequency band.
</P>

<H2>Functions</H2>
<P>You can select one or more functions. Those functions are started when volume goes above 
Enable threshold in respective band, and stopped when it goes below Disable threshold.
</P>

<H2>VC Widgets</H2>
<P>You can select only <B>ONE</B> widget here, either a button, a slider or a speed dial. Depending on the type:
<UL>
<LI><B>Button</B> is pressed when volume goes above Enable threshold, and released when the volume is 
below Disable threshold (similar to functions).</LI>
<LI><B>Slider</B> is moved proportionally to the volume (similar to DMX channels). For slider
the thresholds do not apply.</LI>
<LI><B>Speed dial</B> is tapped when the volume goes above Enable threshold, and won't be tapped again 
until the volume falls below Disable threshold. That means you probably have to set the threshold 
little closer to each other than for buttons.</LI>
</UL>
</P>

<P>Note: Controlling widgets works now only if the audio triggers widget was created <B>later</B> than the controlled widget.
