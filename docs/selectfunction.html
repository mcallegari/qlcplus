<H1>Select Function(s)</H1>
<P>
Whenever a <A HREF="file:concept.html#Functions">Function</A> needs to be selected,
for example when you're adding steps to a <A HREF="file:concept.html#Chaser">Chaser</A>,
using the <A HREF="file:chasereditor.html">Chaser Editor</A>, the <B>Select Function</B>
dialog is used.
</P>

<P>
Sometimes the place you are selecting the function to, might allow selecting
multiple functions, for example, when adding steps to a Chaser or a Collection.
In those cases, the order in which the functions are selected will also be the
order in which they are added to their destination. Oppositely, when attaching a
function to a button in the <A HREF="file:virtualconsole.html">Virtual Console</A>,
you may select only one function at a time.
</P>

<P>
Refer to your operating system manual for documentation on how to select multiple
items in a list.
