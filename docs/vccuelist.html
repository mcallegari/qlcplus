<H1>Virtual Console Cue List</H1>
<IMG SRC="qrc:/cuelist.png" ALIGN="absmiddle">
<P>
A Cue List provides a list of <A HREF="file:concept.html#Functions">Functions</A> that
you can step through with a single keyboard key. The Cue List is at home in
theatrical shows where the lighting operator needs only to follow the script
and toggle the next cue as the performance goes on.
</P>

<P>
The first column on the Cue List displays the cue number that runs from 1 to
infinity and beyond <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Lightyear">.</A>
The second column shows the individual <A HREF="file:concept.html#Functions">Function</A>
name that has been assigned to that particular cue.
</P>

<P>
<b>Please note</b> that only <A HREF="file:concept.html#Chaser">Chasers</A> 
can be assigned to a Cue List, for the simple reason that the Chaser 
is the only function with a duration. Since any other Function can be added
as a step to a Chaser with the <A HREF="file:chasereditor.html">Chaser Editor</A>,
it is simple to create the desired Cues by mixing <A HREF="file:concept.html#Scene">Scenes</A>, 
<A HREF="file:concept.html#Collection">Collections</A>, and so on...
</P>

<H3>Hint</H3>

<P>
When a step is added to a Chaser using the <A HREF="file:chasereditor.html">Chaser Editor</A>, the default 
duration is set to 0.<br>
To avoid your actions in the Cue List to loop endlessly without any result, please set the duration
of your steps, either by double clicking on the duration field or by using the 
Speed Dial widget<IMG src="qrc:/speed.png"><br>
Please note that if you need light scenes that you're going to change manually with the 
Cue List widget, you might want to set the duration to "infinite" (&infin;) using the Speed Dial widget
enabled in the Chaser Editor by clicking on the <IMG src="qrc:/speed.png"> button.
