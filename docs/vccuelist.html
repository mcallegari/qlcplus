<H1>Virtual Console Cue List</H1>
<IMG SRC="qrc:/cuelist.png" ALIGN="absmiddle">
<P>
A Cue List provides a list of <A HREF="file:concept.html#Functions">Functions</A> that
you can step through with a single keyboard key. The Cue List is at home in
theatrical shows where the lighting operator needs only to follow the script
and toggle the next cue as the performance goes on.
</P>

<P>
The first column on the Cue List displays the cue number that runs from 1 to
infinity and beyond <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Lightyear">.</A>
The second column shows the individual <A HREF="file:concept.html#Functions">Function</A>
name that has been assigned to that particular cue.
</P>

<P>
<b>Please note</b> that only <A HREF="file:concept.html#Chaser">Chasers</A> 
can be assigned to a Cue List, for the simple reason that the Chaser 
is the only function with a duration. Since any other Function can be added
as a step to a Chaser with the <A HREF="file:chasereditor.html">Chaser Editor</A>,
it is simple to create the desired Cues by mixing <A HREF="file:concept.html#Scene">Scenes</A>, 
<A HREF="file:concept.html#Collection">Collections</A>, and so on...
</P>

<H3>Operate mode</H3>

<P>
When switching QLC+ to <A HREF="file:concept.html#Modes">Operate Mode</A>, the Cue List will
become active, allowing the selection of the desired steps included in the associated Chaser.<br><br>
Four buttons are displayed at the bottom of the Cue List widget:<br>

<TABLE BORDER="1">
 <TR>
  <TD><IMG src="qrc:/player_play.png"><IMG src="qrc:/player_stop.png"></TD>
  <TD>Start/stop the selected action in the Cue List</TD>
 </TR>
 <TR>
  <TD><IMG src="qrc:/back.png"></TD>
  <TD>The previous action in the Cue List will be activated. 
  When reaching the top, the previous action will be the last of the Cue List</TD>
 </TR>
 <TR>
  <TD><IMG src="qrc:/forward.png"></TD>
  <TD>The next action in the Cue List will be activated. 
  When reaching the bottom, the next action will be the first of the Cue List</TD>
 </TR>
 <TR>
  <TD><IMG src="qrc:/slider.png"></TD>
  <TD>When clicked, this button will open/close a side panel showing two sliders.<br>
  Each slider is connected to an action and to understand their meaning we'll call them 
  "current action" and "next action" sliders. The label on the bottom will show the corresponding
  color and number of the running action.<br>
  The checkbox on the top will link the sliders together for a linear transition<br>
  When the Cue list is running the sliders will control the intensity of the 
  associated actions, overriding their Fade In speed, to allow manual control
  of the transition between two actions.<br>
  When the current action slider will reach zero value, the next action slider will turn to blue,
  to indicate the action has been stopped and the Cue list moved to the next action.
  At this point the next action slider becomes the current action and what was current action 
  becomes next action.<br>
  In this way it is possible to manually crossfade two sequential actions.</TD>
 </TR>
</TABLE>

</P>

<br>
<H3>Hint</H3>

<P>
When a step is added to a Chaser using the <A HREF="file:chasereditor.html">Chaser Editor</A>, the default 
duration is set to 0.<br>
To avoid your actions in the Cue List to loop endlessly without any result, please set the duration
of your steps, either by double clicking on the duration field or by using the 
Speed Dial widget<IMG src="qrc:/speed.png"><br>
Please note that if you need light scenes that you're going to change manually with the 
Cue List widget, you might want to set the duration to "infinite" (&infin;) using the Speed Dial widget
enabled in the Chaser Editor by clicking on the <IMG src="qrc:/speed.png"> button.
