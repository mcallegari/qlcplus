<H1>Select Fixture(s)</H1>
<P>
Whenever a <A HREF="file:concept.html#Fixture">Fixture</A> needs to be selected, for
example when adding fixtures to a <A HREF="concept.html#Scene">Scene</A> function,
the <B>Select Fixture(s)</B> dialog is used.
</P>

<P>
The dialog is very straightforward; there is only a list of fixtures that you
can select from. In some cases you are allowed to select multiple fixtures, for example, when adding fixtures to a
<A HREF="file:concept.html#Scene">Scene</A> or an <A HREF="file:concept.html#EFX">EFX</A>.
In these cases, the order in which the fixtures are selected will also be the
order in which they are added to their destination.
</P>

<P>
Refer to your operating system manual for documentation on how to select multiple
items in a list.
