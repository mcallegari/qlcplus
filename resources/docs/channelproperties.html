<P>
This window displays a tree with items nested in a Universes/Fixtures/Channels structure.<br>
On the right side of each fixture's channel are displayed the available options that can
be set to modify the behaviour of each single channel.<br>

<H2>Channels properties</H2>

<TABLE BORDER=1 class="qlcTable">
 <TR>
  <TD><B>Can fade</B></TD>
  <TD>Determine if a channel is included or excluded in the QLC+ fade transitions.<br>
      By default all the channels are affected by the Fade In and Fade Out timings
      of the QLC+ functions.<br>
      When this property is unchecked, a channel will not fade, meaning that 
      a fade transition from 20 to 200, will set the channel immediately to 200.<br>
      This is useful for example for Pan/Tilt channels of moving heads, where you want
      the motors to avoid fading but immediately go to the final value.
  </TD>
 </TR>
 <TR>
  <TD><B>Behaviour</B></TD>
  <TD>Force the channel behaviour according to the <A HREF="file:concept.html#HTP">HTP</A> and
      <A HREF="file:concept.html#LTP">LTP</A> rules. When changing the behaviour of a channel,
      the dropdown list will highlight in red, showing evidence that the channels has been modified.<br>
      <b>Note: Use this functionality only if you know what you're doing and fully understand
      how HTP and LTP work</b>
  </TD>
 </TR>
 <TR>
  <TD><B>Modifier</B></TD>
  <TD>Channels modifiers are a powerful tool to modify the behaviour of a channel
      by acting at the end of the DMX value calculation, right before the 
      <A HREF="file:concept.html#GrandMaster">Grand Master</A> modification.<br>
      By default all the channels will follow a linear rule, meaning that the original
      DMX value will be equal to the output DMX value. (0-0, 1-1, ... , 255-255)<br>
      When clicking on this button, the Channel Modfier Editor panel (described below) will be displayed.
 </TR>
</TABLE>

<br>
When dealing with a lot of fixtures of the same type, you might want to check 
the "Apply changes to fixtures of the same type" check box.<br>
This means that changing a channel property will affect all the channels of the same type and
fixture in the list.<br>
This can save you quite a lot of time when setting up your projects for the first time.
</P>

<H2>Channel Modfier Editor</H2>

<P>
The channel modifier editor is presented like this:<br>
<img src="file:images/channelmodifier.png"></img>
<br><br>
On the right side of the window, a list of available modifier templates is displayed.<br>
Clicking on a template in the list, will show the curve preview on the left side of 
the window.<br>
A modifier curve is composed by a number of lines representing how a DMX channel
should be modified when its value changes.<br>
Each line starts and ends with a so called "handler". A modifier can have a virtually
infinite number of handlers, but there must be always one handler on the DMX value 0 and one
handler on the DMX value 255 to cover all the DMX values range.<br>
Basically the X coordinate of the preview represents the original DMX value and the Y coordinate
represents the modified DMX value.<br>
When clicking on a handler this gets clearer as the fields above the curve preview
are filled with the said values.<br>
Handlers can be simply moved with the mouse by dragging them around or by manually
changing the values of the original or modified DMX values.<br>
<br>
QLC+ delivers a few templates that might cover the most common cases.<br>
For example the "Invert" template can invert a Pan/Tilt channel where a product doesn't have
this feature by factory default.<br>
The "Logarithmic" template can improve the fade transitions of LED-based fixtures, trying to
bring them back to a more linear effect.<br>
To create a new template just select an existing template, give it a new name and add/remove handlers
as needed with the <IMG SRC="qrc:/edit_add.png"> and <IMG SRC="qrc:/edit_remove.png"> buttons.<br>
When done, just click the <IMG SRC="qrc:/filesave.png"> button and your template will be saved
in your user templates folder. Please refer to the 
<A HREF="file:questionsandanswers.html">Questions and Answers</A> page to locate this folder.
