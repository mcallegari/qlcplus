<H1>GUI style customization</H1>

<P>Starting from version 4.5.0, QLC+ can read a user custom file to change the GUI
appearance in a very accessible way.<BR>
If no file is found, QLC+ will start with the default style.</P>

<H2>The GUI style file</H2>

<P>The file name is hardcoded into QLC+ and must be: <CODE>qlcplusStyle.qss</CODE><BR>
The style file must also be placed in a specific path which is:<BR>
<UL>
 <LI><b>Linux</b>: $HOME/.qlcplus</LI>
 <LI><b>Windows</b>: Your user folder/QLC+</LI>
 <LI><b>OSX</b>: Library/Application Support/QLC+</LI>
</UL>

The style file must have a CSS syntax. If you're comfortable with web designing, you should
find the creation of this file very easy !<BR>
Since the style file is strictly related to the inner Qt objects, you might want
to read the following articles to find out the elements' names and the additional
CSS properties the Qt team added to the default CSS syntax.<br>

<A HREF="http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-4.8/stylesheet-examples.html">Qt Style Sheets Examples</A><BR>
It is up to your imagination how you prefer to customize the QLC+ GUI appearance! If you find
a style worth sharing, don't forget to send in your contribution by posting it online in the 
<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/p/qlcplus/discussion/">QLC+ forum</A>
</P>

<H2>QLC+ dark blue style example</H2>
<P>Just to give you an example of how easy this process is, here's a blue-ish dark style for QLC+.<BR>
If you copy the following lines into <CODE>qlcplusStyle.qss</CODE> in the right location as explained above,
you will see it immediately applied to QLC+.</P>
