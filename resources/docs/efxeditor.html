<H3 id="fixture-order">Fixture Order</H3>

<P>
Fixtures taking part in an EFX function can be set to follow the algorithm in certain order:
</P>
<LI><B>Parallel:</B> all fixtures follow the same pattern synchronously</LI>
<LI><B>Serial:</B> fixtures start following the pattern one after the other, with a
little delay between each of them.</LI>
<LI><B>Asymmetric:</B> all fixtures start moving simultaneously, but with similar offset as
in the Serial mode.</LI>
</P>

<H3 id="direction">Direction</H3>

<P>
EFX functions' direction can be reversed for all fixtures at once or on a
per-fixture basis. The function can also be set to do an infinite loop, an
infinite ping-pong-loop (direction is reversed after each pass) or it can run
through just once, in a single-shot mode, after which it terminates by itself.
If the function is set to do an infinite loop, it must be stopped manually.
</P>

<H3 id="efx-intensity">EFX Intensity</H3>

<P>When EFX is started, it will set the intensity of all included fixtures to the preset value.
That usually means it set them full on. If you don't want this, just set the preset intensity to something
lower, perhaps 0. That way you can control intensity of the fixture using other means like VC sliders for
the intensity/dimmer channels, or by another chaser.
</P>

<H3 id="relative-mode">Relative Mode</H3>

<P>EFX position is absolute by default-in other words, the selected EFX will exclusively control the X/Y position 
of the specified heads. When the Relative Mode checkbox is enabled, the EFX position acts as a layer on top of any 
position that has already been set (e.g. by a scene or even another EFX). In other words, the EFX is relative to 
current fixture position. 
</P>

<P>In absolute mode. the EFX can be set to run at specific head position (e. g. do circle downstage center, stage left, etc.)

<P>In relative mode, the center of the preview window (offset x=127, offset y=127) will be applied to current head position.</P>

<P>It is useful to reduce number of EFX presets: let's say we want to have 3 types of EFX (pan saw, tilt saw, circle) at 4 places
(e.g. 4 stage corners). In absolute mode that means 3x4 = 12 presets. If we want to change something, we have to edit many functions.
We most probably need also one VC button for each. In relative mode, we create one EFX preset for each EFX type (pan saw, tilt saw, circle),
and we set offset to neutral (x=127, y=127). Then, we create scenes with PAN & TILT channels for each position. Now we have only 3+4 presets
(and 3+4 VC buttons, preferably in 2 solo frames).
</P>

<P><B>Tips&amp;Tricks</B></P>

<P>In relative mode, it is also possible to fade between positions (set fade time in scenes) while the EFX is running.</P>

<P>Using XYPad and relative mode, it is possible to move EFX to any place during the show.</P>
