<H1>RGB Matrix Editor</H1>
<P>
The RGB matrix editor, as its name suggests, is used to edit
<IMG SRC="qrc:/rgbmatrix.png" align="absmiddle"> <A HREF="file:concept.html#RGBMatrix">RGB matrix</A> functions. 
The function works on predefined
<IMG SRC="qrc:/group.png" align="absmiddle"> <A HREF="file:concept.html#FixtureGroup">Fixture Groups</A> 
created by the user with the <IMG SRC="qrc:/fixture.png" align="absmiddle"> <A HREF="file:fixturemanager.html">Fixture Manager</A>.

   Convert the current RGB Matrix into a <A HREF="file:concept.html#Sequence">Sequence</A>. This is useful to speed
   up the creation of a <A HREF="file:concept.html#Show">Show</A>. Please note that if the selected pattern
   generates random data, this functionality will generate a different Sequence every time.

   When the <B>Audio Spectrum</B> pattern is selected, QLC+ will start capturing data from the chosen
   audio input device and will represent the audio spectrum as vertical bars in the RGB Matrix with the
   selected start and end color.<br>
   For an optimal usage of this pattern, the hold time of the Matrix must be set to a reasonably low value (e.g. .20)

   <P>Styles:</P>
   <UL>
    <LI><B>Static</B> - the image is statically displayed on the matrix. If the image is smaller than the matrix, 
     it is repeated in both directions. (Tip: for stripes, use 1-point-high images)</LI>
    <LI><B>Horizontal</B> - the image is scrolled horizontaly. Again, image is repeated in both directions.</LI>
    <LI><B>Vertical</B> - same as <B>Horizontal</B>, but in vertical direction.</LI>
    <LI><B>Animation</B> - play animation. Stack the frames (of width equal to matrix's) side by side in one image.
     For example, when matrix is 8x8 and you want to have 4 frames, make image 32x8. The image is still repeated
     vertically.</LI>
