<H1>Web Interface</H1>

<P>By default, QLC+ includes a web interface based on the 
<A HREF="http://cesanta.com/mongoose.shtml">Mongoose project</A> HTTP server.<BR>
It comes very handy when you need to run QLC+ on a device without a display (headless system) 
either to work standalone or for remote controlling.<BR>
The web interface is not enabled by default but can be easily activated by running QLC+ with "-w" or "--web" option.
Please refer to the <A HREF="file:commandlineparameters.html">command line paramters</a> page of this documentation
to learn how to do it.
</P>

<P>
The web interface can be accessed from any modern web browser running on any device, such as a computer, 
a tablet or a smartphone. Your browser need to support the web sockets technology to communicate with QLC+.<BR>
It is recommended to use Google Chrome.
</P>

<P>
To access the QLC+ web interface simply connect to this address:<BR>
<B>http://*IP address*:9999</B><BR>
<BR>
Where *IP address* is the IP address of the device you want to access via web. 
For example: http://192.168.0.100:9999<BR>
The web interface consists in two pages:
<UL>
 <LI>Virtual Console</LI>
 <LI>Configuration</LI>
</UL>

<H2>Virtual Console page</H2>
This page is displayed by default when accessing the web interface address 
and it represents the QLC+ Virtual Console.<BR>
If a project is loaded, this page will display the widgets previously created with QLC+, 
otherwise it will just show an empty page.<BR>
It is possible to load a project with the <B>Load project</B> button placed on the 
top left corner of the page. A window will show up, allowing you to choose a file from 
the device you're using to control the device where QLC+ is running.<BR>
The project file will be transferred via web and loaded by QLC+.<BR>
To access the QLC+ configuration page, just click on the <B>Configuration</B> button.

<H2>Configuration page</H2>
<P>
This page allows to remotely set the QLC+ configuration, divided in three areas:

<UL>
 <LI><B>Universes configuration</B>: Allows to set the inputs, outputs, feedback, 
   profiles and passthrough mode for each QLC+ universe. This is basically the same 
   functionality of the QLC+ input/output panel.<BR>
   Since a QLC+ project contains also the I/O information, most likely you won't have to 
   manually configure it on this page, but just check if everything is correct.<BR>
 </LI>
 <LI><B>Audio configuration</B>: Allows to select the audio devices 
   used for audio playback or audio input.<BR>
 </LI>
 <LI><B>User loaded fixtures</B>: Allows to remotely load a custom fixture to QLC+.<BR>
   When clicking on the <B>Load fixture</B> button, a window will show up, allowing you 
   to choose a file from the device you're using to control the device where QLC+ is running.<BR>
   The fixture file will be transferred via web and loaded by QLC+.<BR>
   When adding new custom fixtures it is recommended to reload a project or either restart QLC+
   on the target device.<BR>
 </LI>
</UL>

Once the configuration has been set, it is possible to go back to the web interface 
main page by clicking on the <B>Back</B> button, placed at the top left corner of the page.
