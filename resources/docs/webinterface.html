<H1>Web Interface</H1>

<P>By default, QLC+ includes a native web server to expose on traditional web browsers
some of the software features.<br>
It comes very handy when you need to run QLC+ on a device without a display (headless system) 
either to work standalone or for remote controlling.<BR>
The web interface is not enabled by default but can be easily activated by running QLC+ with "-w" or "--web" option.
Please refer to the <A HREF="file:commandlineparameters.html">command line parameters</a> page of this documentation
to learn how to do it.
</P>

<P>
The web interface can be accessed from any modern web browser running on any device, such as a computer, 
a tablet or a smartphone. Your browser needs to support the web sockets technology to communicate with QLC+, 
and it is recommended to use Google Chrome.<br>
It is also possible to design custom web pages and access QLC+ functionalities via web API which are basically 
strings formatted in a specific way and sent to QLC+ via websocket.<br>
A test page with the available APIs can be found <a href="http://www.qlcplus.org/Test_Web_API.html">here</a>.
</P>

<P>
To access the QLC+ web interface simply connect to this address:<BR>
<B>http://[IP address]:9999</B><BR>
<BR>
Where [IP address] is the IP address of the device you want to access via web. 
For example: http://192.168.0.100:9999<BR>
The web interface consists in three pages:
<UL>
 <LI>Virtual Console</LI>
 <LI>Simple Desk</LI>
 <LI>Configuration</LI>
</UL>

<H2>Virtual Console page</H2>
This page is displayed by default when accessing the web interface address 
and it represents the QLC+ Virtual Console.<BR>
If a project is loaded, this page will display the widgets previously created with QLC+, 
otherwise it will just show an empty page.<BR>
It is possible to load a project with the <B>Load project</B> button placed on the 
top left corner of the page. A window will show up, allowing you to choose a file from 
the device you're using to control the device where QLC+ is running.<BR>
The project file will be transferred via web and loaded by QLC+.<BR>
To access the QLC+ configuration page, just click on the <B>Configuration</B> button.

<H2>Simple Desk page</H2>
<P>
This page is a simplified version of the Simple Desk that you can find in the QLC+ desktop version.
It displays DMX universes divided by pages, where each page shows 32 channels. You can switch between pages with
the left/right arrow buttons and select the current displayed universe with the drop down menu
on the top right of the page.<br>
It is also possible to reset a universe at once by pressing the reset button (gray X)<br>

<H3>DMX Keypad</H3>
When clicking on the "DMX Keypad" button in the Simple Desk top bar, you can jump to a new page
where a traditional DMX keypad is displayed.<br>
The keypad is useful to set a batch of channel values with a single command. Following a table
explaining the key commands that you can find on the right side of the pad.<br>
<br>
<TABLE BORDER=1 class="qlcTable">
 <TR>
  <TD><B>Key</B></TD><TD><B>Description</B></TD>
 </TR>
 <TR>
  <TD>AT</TD>
  <TD>sets a value for a specified DMX channel or group of channels (range).<br>
      Example: <B>13 AT 148</B> (sets channel 13 to value 148) 
  </TD>
 </TR>
 <TR>
  <TD>THRU</TD>
  <TD>selects a range of DMX channels<br>
      Example: <B>3 THRU 15 AT 133</B> (sets channels 3 to 15 to value 133)
  </TD>
 </TR>
 <TR>
  <TD>FULL</TD>
  <TD>sets the maximum value (255) to the selected DMX channels or group of channels<br>
      Example: <B>18 FULL</B> (sets channel 18 to 255)<br>
               <B>1 THRU 10 FULL</B> (sets channels 1 to 10 to 255)
  </TD>
 </TR>
 <TR>
  <TD>ZERO</TD>
  <TD>sets the minimum value (0) to the selected DMX channels or group of channels<br>
      Example: <B>4 ZERO</B> (sets channel 4 to 0)
  </TD>
 </TR>
 <TR>
  <TD>BY</TD>
  <TD>sets a channels gap within a range<br>
      Example: <B>1 THRU 10 BY 2 AT 100</B> (sets channels 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 to value 100)
  </TD>
 </TR>
</TABLE>
<BR>
Please keep in mind that:
<UL>
 <LI>Every command is sent to QLC+ only when pressing the ENTER button</LI>
 <LI>DMX addresses are contiguous between universes, so Universe 1 ranges from 1 to 512,
     Universe 2 from 513 to 1024 and so on</LI>
 <LI>At the moment the +/- keys do nothing. They will be implemented in the future to
     increase/decrease the current value of a channel or group of channels by a certain amount</LI>
 <LI>You can manually write commands in the top text box once you learn the keypad commands syntax</LI>
</UL>
  

<H2>Configuration page</H2>
<P>
This page allows to remotely set the QLC+ configuration, divided in three areas:

<UL>
 <LI><B>Universes configuration</B>: Allows to set the inputs, outputs, feedback, 
   profiles and passthrough mode for each QLC+ universe. This is basically the same 
   functionality of the QLC+ input/output panel.<BR>
   Since a QLC+ project contains also the I/O information, most likely you won't have to 
   manually configure it on this page, but just check if everything is correct.<BR>
 </LI>
 <LI><B>Audio configuration</B>: Allows to select the audio devices 
   used for audio playback or audio input.<BR>
 </LI>
 <LI><B>User loaded fixtures</B>: Allows to remotely load a custom fixture to QLC+.<BR>
   When clicking on the <B>Load fixture</B> button, a window will show up, allowing you 
   to choose a file from the device you're using to control the device where QLC+ is running.<BR>
   The fixture file will be transferred via web and loaded by QLC+.<BR>
   When adding new custom fixtures it is recommended to reload a project or either restart QLC+
   on the target device.<BR>
 </LI>
</UL>

Once the configuration has been set, it is possible to go back to the web interface 
main page by clicking on the <B>Back</B> button, placed at the top left corner of the page.
</P>
