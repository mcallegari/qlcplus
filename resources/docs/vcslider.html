<P>
Sliders are used for two distinct purposes: <A HREF="file:concept.html#Fixtures">Fixture</A>
channel level setting and <A HREF="file:concept.html#Functions">Function</A> playback and intensity
adjustment. Any slider can operate on either of these modes and each mode has its own
configuration options.

<P>
Sliders can be configured with the properties
<IMG SRC="qrc:/edit.png" ALIGN="bottom"> button found in the toolbar or
by double clicking the slider itself.
</P>

<H3>Configuration - General Tab</H3>

<P>
The General tab holds all of the slider's properties that are shared between
the slider's two modes.

    slider. The latest combination is shown on the text boxes when QLC+ receives
    input data. If you don't see anything in the boxes, your input connection
    might have a problem that you need to fix first.</LI>

  </TD>
 </TR> 
 <TR>
  <TD><B>Click & Go</B></TD>
  <TD>
   Click & Go is a QLC+ technology which allows you to quickly access fixtures functionalities in
   a completely visual way. When Click & Go is enabled, a button will appear at the bottom
   of the slider and with just 2 clicks you will reach the desired result.<br>
   The supported modes are:
   <ul>
    <li>None: Click & Go disabled. No button will be displayed.</li>
    <li>Color: Single color selection. A gradient of the color controlled by the slider will be displayed, allowing you to jump
    to the desired color visually.</li>
    <li>RGB: RGB color selection. A RGB Color picker will be displayed, allowing you to pick any color from black to white.
    16 preset colors are displayed on the left side for convenience. When selecting a color, the slider value will be 
    placed half way (128). Moving it downward will fade towards black, while moving it upward will fade towards white.</li>
    <li>Gobo/Effect: Gobo/Macro selection. A grid view of the fixture defined macros will be displayed and you will be able to choose
    a macro from its color, its gobo or its name. When the mouse is over a macro cell, a blue bar will appear, allowing you to
    choose an intermediate value within the same macro. This is useful for functionalities like Gobo rotation speed.</li>
   </ul>
  </TD>
 </TR>
</TABLE>

<H3>Configuration - Playback Tab</H3>

<P>
If the slider is not currently in Playback mode, all you see is a button telling you
to click it to switch to Playback mode. After you click it, the
Playback mode properties will be shown.
</P>

<P>
When the slider is in playback mode, the slider acts like a combined button and slider.
You can start a function AND simultaneously control the function's intensity with the slider.
When the slider is at zero, the function is stopped but any value above zero will start
the function (unless it has already been started) and simultaneously adjust the function's intensity
(if applicable).
</P>

<TABLE BORDER=1 class="qlcTable">
 <TR>
  <TD><B>Function</B></TD>
  <TD>
   Displays the function that is currently attached to the slider.
  </TD>

 <TR>
  <TD>
   <IMG SRC="qrc:/detach.png"/>
  </TD>
  <TD>
   Detach the currently attached function.
  </TD>
 </TR>
</TABLE>

<H3>Configuration - Submaster Tab</H3>

<P>
If the slider is not currently in Submaster mode, all you see is a button telling you
to click it to switch to Submaster mode. After you click it, the slider will be
set to work as a submaster.
</P>

<P>
When a slider is set to Submaster mode, it will control the intensity of every other 
widget in the same frame (please keep in mind that the main Virtual Console area
is a frame too !)<br>
The intensity of a widget depends on the type of widget itself and which functionality
it controls. A submaster will control the intensity of any QLC+ "light emitting"
functionality, either a function or single channel levels.<br>
For example a submaster can control the intensity of a function attached to a 
<A HREF="file:vcbutton.html">button</A> or the channel levels associated to a 
slider in level mode.<br>
Every widget is controlled by a submaster even if the widget's functionality
is not active yet. For example if a submaster is set to 50%, a button pressed
afterward will start its associated function with 50% of intensity.
