The video editor, as its name suggests, is used to edit

<H2>Controls</H2>

<TABLE BORDER=1 class="qlcTable">
 <TR>
  <TD>
   <img src="qrc:/player_play.png" />
  </TD>
  <TD>
    Start/stop the video playback. If the file doesn't exist or an invalid URL has been entered, this button will have no effect
  </TD>
 </TR>
 <TR>
  <TD>
   <B>Video name</B>
  </TD>
  <TD>
   Change the name of the Video function. By default this is set with the file name, until it is manually changed.
  </TD>
 </TR>
 <TR>
  <TD>
   <B>File name</B>
  </TD>
  <TD>
   If the attached file is local, displays the absolute path of the video file.
   A local source file can be changed by clicking on the "..." button on the right side.<br>
   It is also possible to stream a video from the network. Just click on the <img src="qrc:/global.png" />
   button and enter a valid HTTP URL.
  </TD>
 </TR>
 <TR>
  <TD>
   <B>Duration</B>
  </TD>
  <TD>
   Displays the video file duration in the typical QLC+ way. For example: 04m14s.22.
  </TD>
 </TR>
 <TR>
  <TD>
   <B>Resolution</B>
  </TD>
  <TD>
   Displays the resolution in pixels detected on the attached video file.<br>
   <B>Note</B>: since QLC+ relies on the <A HREF="https://www.qt.io/">Qt libraries</A> to play video sources,
   there is a known issue for which Qt is not able to detect the size (and codecs) of videos in Windows and Mac OSX.<br>
   Basically a size of "0x0" will be displayed. The fullscreen video playback will be OK though.<br>
   On detection failure, a default size of 640x480 pixels is internally set to allow the windowed mode to work.<br>
   Hopefully this will be fixed by the Qt team in the future.
