<H1><IMG SRC="qrc:/speed.png" ALIGN="absmiddle"> Virtual Console Speed Dial</H1>

<P>
Speed dials are meant for adjusting the speed of a set of functions from virtual console,
much like bus-mode sliders in the previous versions of QLC+. While the bus concept relied on
assigning functions and a slider to the same bus, the speed dial's method is a simpler and
more straightforward one: The user directly selects a set of functions whose speed properties are
controlled with the dial, thus removing the need for buses in the middle.
</P>

<br>
The widget is displayed as following:<br>

<H3>Widget elements</H3>

<TABLE BORDER=1 class="qlcTable">
 <TR>
  <TD><B>(1) Time control buttons</B></TD>
  <TD>The plus and minus buttons increment or decrement by one the currently focused time field of <B>(4)</B>.
      By default the focused field is milliseconds</TD>
 </TR>
 <TR>
  <TD><B>(2) Dial</B></TD>
  <TD>The dial can be manually rotated indefinitely to adjust the current focused time field of <B>(4)</B>.
      By default the focused field is milliseconds</TD>
 </TR>
 <TR>
  <TD><B>(3) Tap Button</B></TD>
  <TD>The tap button sets the Speed Dial time value to the interval between the button press/release actions.
      The faster it will be pressed, the lower the time value will be</TD>
 </TR>
 <TR>
  <TD><B>(4) Time fields</B></TD>
  <TD>The 4 time fields display the current time value of the Speed Dial and they can be adjusted individually
      either by entering a number with a keyboard, or by using the time controls buttons <B>(1)</B>, the
      dial <B>(2)</B>, the tap button <B>(3)</B> or presets <B>(11)</B>.
  </TD>
 <TR>
  <TD><B>(5) Divider button</B></TD>
  <TD>Divide the current time factor by 2 and apply it to the current Speed Dial time.<br>
  A factor lower than 1x will become a fraction like 1/2x, 1/4x, etc</TD>
 </TR>
 <TR>
  <TD><B>(6) Time factor</B></TD>
  <TD>Displays the current factor multiplied by the time currently displayed in <B>(4)</B>.<br>
  A factor lower than 1x is a divider. Example: time = 8s.28, factor = 1/4x, result = 02s.07 </TD>
 </TR>
 <TR>
  <TD><B>(7) Multiplier button</B></TD>
  <TD>Multiply the current time factor by 2 and apply it to the current Speed Dial time.</TD>
 </TR>
 <TR>
  <TD><B>(8) Reset button</B></TD>
  <TD>Reset the current time factor to 1x and apply it to the current Speed Dial time.</TD>
 </TR>
 <TR>
  <TD><B>(9) Factored time</B></TD>
  <TD>Displays the result of the Speed Dial time multiplied by the current time factor <B>(6)</B></TD>
 </TR>
 <TR>
  <TD><B>(10) Apply button</B></TD>
  <TD>Applies the current Speed Dial time to the Functions associated. This is useful when multiple
      Speed Dials are present in a Virtual Console</TD>
 </TR>
 <TR>
  <TD><B>(11) Preset buttons</B></TD>
  <TD>This area displays the time presets, if present, added by the user</TD>
 </TR>
</TABLE>

<H3>Operation</H3>

<P>
The speed dial itself looks and works just as the same as the speed dials in various function
editors: There is a <B>big dial (2)</B> in the middle that increases the time when rotated clockwise
and decreases it when rotated counter-clockwise. The plus
<IMG SRC="qrc:/edit_add.png" HEIGHT="16"/> and minus
<IMG SRC="qrc:/edit_remove.png" HEIGHT="16"/> buttons <B>(1)</B> are an alternative way of adjusting the speed.
</P>

<P>
The <B>current time</B> value  <B>(4)</B> is displayed in four parts. When any of these fields is clicked,
the dial and the plus/minus buttons will increase/decrease that unit of time. The mouse
wheel can also be used instead of the dial/buttons and the fields also accept values entered
on the numeric keypad.
<LI><B>h</B>: Hours</LI>
<LI><B>m</B>: Minutes</LI>
<LI><B>s</B>: Seconds</LI>
<LI><B>.xx</B>: Centiseconds (100ths of a second)</LI>
</P>

<P>
The <B>tap</B> button <B>(3)</B> can be used to match the time to a beat.
The elapsed time between clicks is measured and this time is set for the controlled functions, just as if the dial
had been adjusted to that particular time.
</P>

<P>For cuelists/chasers and RGB Matrices, the tap button advances the function to next step/position when
speed dial is set to adjust duration. The tapped tempo must be more than 1/4 of the original duration.
</P>

<H3>Configuration - Functions tab</H3>
<P>
Speed dials can be configured with the properties

<H3>Configuration - Appearance tab</H3>
<P>
Individual visibility of the widget's layout elements can be switched on or off here. This way it is possible to
save some screen real estate if some of the fields are not needed (e.g. when controlled by an external controller,
the big dial is not needed).

Here it is possible to select if the multiply factor should be reset when the dial <B>(2)</B> is manually
adjusted and individual external controls for the multiplier button <B>(5)</B>, the divider button <B>(7)</B>
and the reset factor button <B>(8)</B>

<H3>Configuration - Presets tab</H3>
<P>
A preset is a way to have a quick access to a predifined value for a speed dial.<br>
Each preset is represented as a button in the speed dial widget layout,
and can be either clicked with the mouse or pressed on a touchscreen, or
associated to a key combination or an external controller input line.<br>
On the left of the preset tab, there is the list of presets. When selecting a preset
in this list, the button on the right will be able to edit its properties.
