<H1>RGB Matrix Editor</H1>
<P>
The RGB matrix editor, as its name suggests, is used to edit
<IMG SRC="qrc:/rgbmatrix.png" align="absmiddle"> <A HREF="file:concept.html#RGBMatrix">RGB matrix</A> functions.
The function works on predefined
<IMG SRC="qrc:/group.png" align="absmiddle"> <A HREF="file:concept.html#FixtureGroup">Fixture Groups</A>
created by the user with the <IMG SRC="qrc:/fixture.png" align="absmiddle"> <A HREF="file:fixturemanager.html">Fixture Manager</A>.

   <B>Pattern</B>
  </TD>
  <TD>
   Select the pattern and colors that are used on the selected fixture group for drawing graphics.<br>
   Patterns can be:
   <UL>
    <LI><B>Plain Color</B>: all the pixels of the matrix will be lit to the selected color</LI>
    <br>
    <LI><B>Animated Text</B>: display an animated text with the following parameters:
      <UL>
        <LI>The text edit field is used to edit the text content that is scrolled/flashed on the matrix.</LI>
        <LI>The font button <IMG SRC="qrc:/fonts.png"/> is used to select the font (tip: bitmap fonts work best)</LI>
        <LI>The drop-down box is used to select the animation style (Horizontal, Vertical or Letters)</LI>
      </UL>
    </LI>
    <br>
    <LI><B>Audio Spectrum</B>: QLC+ will start capturing data from the chosen audio input device and will
      represent the audio spectrum as vertical bars in the RGB Matrix with the selected start and end color.<br>
      For an optimal usage of this pattern, the hold time of the Matrix must be set to a reasonably low value (e.g. .20)
    </LI>
    <br>
    <LI><B>Image</B>: display an image loaded from a file, with the following parameters:
      <UL>
        <LI>The text edit field is used to edit the image filename</LI>
        <LI>The image button <IMG SRC="qrc:/image.png"/> is used to load an image from file</LI>
	<LI>The drop-down box is used to select the animation style (Static, Horizontal, Vertical or Animation)</LI>
      </UL>
      <P>Supported formats: PNG, XPM, JPG, GIF (for animated gifs only first frame is used).</P>
      <P>Styles:</P>
      <UL>
	<LI><B>Static</B> - the image is statically displayed on the matrix. If the image is smaller than the matrix,
	it is repeated in both directions. (Tip: for stripes, use 1-point-high images)</LI>
	<LI><B>Horizontal</B> - the image is scrolled horizontaly. Again, image is repeated in both directions.</LI>
	<LI><B>Vertical</B> - same as <B>Horizontal</B>, but in vertical direction.</LI>
	<LI><B>Animation</B> - play animation. Stack the frames (of width equal to matrix's) side by side in one image.
	For example, when matrix is 8x8 and you want to have 4 frames, make image 32x8. The image is still repeated
	vertically.</LI>
      </UL>
    </LI>
    <BR>
    The rest of the pattern list is filled with <A HREF="file:concept.html#RGBScript">RGB Scripts</A>
    loaded when QLC+ starts up.<br>
    Depending on the selected pattern, it is possible to choose a start and an end color. Some patterns
    do not allow colors at all (since they elapse them autonomously) or allow just one color.<br>
  </TD>
 </TR>
 <TR>
  <TD>
   <B>Pattern Blend Mode</B>
  </TD>
  <TD>The blend mode is the mechanism used to mix multiple RGB Matrices running
    one on top of the other.<br>
    Here's a representation of how it works:
    <P><IMG SRC="file:../images/blending.png" /></P>
    The matrix running on the bottom layer must use the default mode, to
    prepare a ground of colors that all the above layers can use to perform
    blending.
  </TD>
 </TR>
 <TR>
  <TD>
   <B>Pattern Color Mode</B>
  </TD>
  <TD>The color mode is the mechanism select which color channels the RGB Matrices applies to.<br>
    Default setting is RGB mode, addressing RGB channels or CMY channels. If set otherwise, only the
    selected channels (e.g. "White") whill be set in a grayscale of the selected color(s). Channels not
    representing the selected color mode (e.g. R, G and B) will not be touched.

    <LI><B>X:</B> Used to shift the pattern along the horizontal x-axis (negative
        values go to the left, positive values go to the right)</LI>
    <LI><B>Y:</B> Used to shift the pattern along the vertical y-axis (negative
        values go up, positive values go down)</LI>
