<P>
XY Pad is a Virtual Console widget dedicated to fixtures positioning.<br>
It can handle the typical DMX movement channels (<B>pan</B> and <B>tilt</B>)
of intelligent lighting fixtures, namely scanners and moving heads.<br>
The pad is a resizable area, surrounded by several controls to cover the
needs you might have during a live show.<br>
It is displayed as following:<br>

    0&deg; is in the middle of the range (DMX value 127.127). For example, if pan range for a fixture is 540&deg;,
    the displayed angle will be between -270&deg; and 270&deg;.<BR />

<H3>Limiting the working area</H3>

<P>
The XY Pad is basically a map of the whole range of degrees that the pan and tilt channels of your fixtures can manage.<br>
Here's a picture representing how the main area normally represents degrees:<br>
<IMG SRC="../images/xypad2.png" />
<BR>
There are cases though where you want to limit the degrees a moving head or a scanner could reach.<br>
For example fixtures with a 540&deg; Pan range, should be limited to work only in a range facing the audience,
or you might want to avoid that moving heads mounted upside down on a truss will point to the ceiling or outside the stage.<br>
With the XY Pad, there are 2 ways to achieve this:
</P>

<B>1. Working window</B>
<P>
With the top and left range sliders <B>(1)</B>, it is possible to limit the area where the XY Pad will work.<br>
When reducing the range of those sliders, a semi transparent green area <B>(7)</B> will be highlighted on top of the main area,
to mark the X/Y limits where your fixtures should operate.<br>
Note that when using a mouse on the user interface, the movement of the handles will be limited to the working window,
even if you drag the cursor outside of it, while when using an external controller all the values will be scaled to the window,
so you will be able to use the full range of a physical fader, thus having more sensitivity when setting a position.
</P>

<B>2. Individual fixture range</B>
<P>
It is possible to set a specific range for each fixture in the properties dialog (see the <B>Configuration</B> paragraph).
With this method, the whole main area <B>(8)</B> is used and every specified range of each fixture is scaled onto it.<br>
This come very handy when you want to use a XY Pad with mixed fixtures, with different ranges of degrees.<br>
</P>
<P>For example you can make a 540&deg; degrees Pan to move exactly like a 360&deg; degrees Pan.</P>

<P>Another example: set fixture X Axis (Pan) minimum to 20% (DMX value 51), maximum to 80% (DMX value 204).
When the handle is at the left edge (value 0), the actual DMX output is 51. Similarly, handle at the right
edge will output 204 (=80%). For values in between, the DMX output is scaled proportionally.</P>

<P>It is possible to have both limits enabled (using the range sliders and limits per fixtures).<P>

<H3>XY Pad usages</H3>
<P>
The XY Pad allows 3 completely different usages, but all targeted to positioning. It's up to you to
decide the best use of them depending on your needs. You also might want to consider the usage
of multiple XY Pads with different purposes.<br>
<UL>
 <LI><B>1- Absolute positioning</B>: this is the basic usage and it requires only to specify which fixtures you
 intend to control (added via Configuration window) and eventually their specific range of operation.<BR>
 As previosuly described all you need to do is to setup your fixtures once and start moving them with your
 favourite controller.<BR>
 It is also possible to define some position presets, so a number of buttons will be displayed in <B>(9)</B> to
 quickly recall an absolute position.<br>
 If a Fixture Group preset is activated, the XY Pad will control the absolute positions only of the
 Fixtures defined in the preset. (see Presets tab for more info)
 </LI>
 <br>
 <LI><B>2- EFX</B>: In the Configuration window (Presets tab), it is possible to add some presets to recall
 existing <IMG SRC="qrc:/efx.png" ALIGN="absmiddle"> <A HREF="concept.html#EFX">EFX</A> functions.
 When activating a EFX preset, the animated preview of the fixtures movements will be displayed like this:<br>
 <IMG SRC="../images/xypad-efx.png" /><br>
 If no working window is set, the EFX will be be displayed exactly like it is previewed in the
 <A HREF="efxeditor.html">EFX Editor</A>. Otherwise, the EFX will be scaled to fit the
 defined working window.<br>
 If a working window is active, it will be shared between usage #1 and usage #2.
 </LI>
 <br>
 <LI><B>3- Relative to a Scene</B>: In the Configuration window (Presets tab), it is also possible to add
 some presets to recall existing <IMG SRC="qrc:/scene.png" ALIGN="absmiddle"> <A HREF="concept.html#Scene">Scene</A> functions<br>
 XY Pad will detect which Pan/Tilt channels are present in the Scene and set them.<br>
 The Pad handle <B>(6)</B> will automatically position itself to the center of the main area <B>(8)</B>.
 Moving the handle, will produce relative values from the center of the Pad, that will be added/subtracted to the
 DMX values of the running Scene.<br>
 Moving up will add a negative offset to Tilt channels and moving down will add a positive offset.<br>
 Moving left will add a negative offset to Pan channels and moving right will add a positive offset.<br>
 When activating a Scene preset, is a working window is active, it will be hidden, as there's no absolute values
 involved in this usage. When switching back to usage #1 or #2, the working window will be restored.<br>
 Please note that when a Scene preset is activated, the whole Scene will be actually started, with colors and
 everything. It is suggested in this case to create Scenes only with Pan/Tilt channels enabled, not to involve
 a XY Pad in other matters.
</UL>
</P>

<H3>Keyboard control</H3>

<P>It is possible to control head position with arrow keys on the keyboard. Each keypress increases/decreases coarse value by 1.
With Shift key pressed, fine channel is changed by 1. With Ctrl, the step is 10 instead of 1.
