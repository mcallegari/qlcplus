<P>
Fixture Definition Editor is a separate application bundled together with QLC+ for creating and modifying
<A HREF="file:concept.html#Fixtures">fixture definitions</A> used by QLC+. The
definitions tell QLC+ (and users) important details about fixtures, such as
which channel is used for pan movement, what value in which channel changes
the beam color to green, how the fixture is reset etc...
</P>

<P>
The main window in the Fixture Editor is just an empty workspace that contains
the actual editor windows used to edit fixture definitions.
</P>

<P>
<B>Important note: for many reasons, you SHOULD NOT save or copy your custom fixtures in the
QLC+ system fixtures folder. The most important is that when you uninstall QLC+, the system
fixtures folder gets deleted, so your fixtures.<br>
You are recommended to save them in the user fixtures folder. To find it, please refer to the
<A HREF="file:questionsandanswers.html">Q & A section</A> of this documentation.</B>

Following, the description of the settings that appear in the Channel Editor.
Reference to the above figures will be done to point you to a visual context.
</P>

<TABLE BORDER=1 class="qlcTable">
 <TR>
  <TD><B>Name</B></TD>
  <TD>The channel name. When selecting a channel preset (single capability channel), a channel name will be
      automatically suggested, with the possibility to customize it.</TD>
 </TR>
 <TR>
  <TD><B>Preset</B></TD>
  <TD>A preset is a sort of shortcut to speed up the definition creation. It also provides to the QLC+
   engine, useful information to recognize and properly treat a DMX channel.<br>
   It frequently happens that a Fixture has some RGB or CMY channels. A LED bar might have dozens of them.
   Therefore, selecting a color preset will fill in for you all the necessary information that QLC+ needs,
   with a single mouse click. (See Fig. 1)<br>
   It is also frequent to find a channel to control Pan/Tilt speed. Some presets are available for
   that purpose, indicating also if the speed is from slow to fast or from fast to slow. Just pick the
   preset that is more suitable for the definition you're creating.<br>
   When a preset is selected, all the rest of the editor become inactive. If a channel has multiple DMX
   ranges (capabilities), just leave "Preset" to "Custom" and proceed further with this reading.
 </TR>
 <TR>
  <TD><B>Type</B></TD>
  <TD>
   <P>This indicated the channel's type (its role in the fixture). Selecting a type, implicitely defines also
    the channel precedence (<A HREF="file:concept.html#LTP">LTP</A> or <A HREF="file:concept.html#HTP">HTP</A>).
    It is therefore very important to pick the correct type here, to avoid undesired behaviours within QLC+.<br>
    All the intensity/color channel types obey to the <B>HTP</B> rule: <B>Intensity, Red, Green, Blue,
    Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, White, Amber, UV, Lime and Indigo</B>.<br>
    All the other types obey to the <B>LTP</B> rule: <B>Beam, Color, Effect, Gobo, Maintenance, Nothing, Pan, Tilt,
    Prism, Shutter and Speed</B>.<br>

   <LI><B>Intensity</B> is used for dimmer / master dimmer channels.<br></LI>
   <LI><B>Primary colors</B> (Red, Cyan, White, etc) are used to control single color channels. Please
       do not confuse these types with the "Color" type (see below)<br>
       Note that the <A HREF="file:concept.html#GrandMaster">Grand Master</A> controls only Intensity
       and primary color channels by default. Note also that the Color Tool
       in <A HREF="file:sceneeditor.html">Scene Editor</A> is available only if a fixture provides
       <B>Primary color</B> channels for RGBAWUV/CMY.</LI>
   <LI>The <B>Color</B> type is used to control a fixed color
       wheel or pre-defined color macros. <I>Don't</I> assign individual RGBAW/CMY color channels
       to the </B>Color</B> type but instead use the <B>primary color</B> types as described above
       </LI>
   <LI>The <B>Gobo</B> type is used to control gobo wheel position or indexing. </LI>
   <LI>The <B>Speed</B> type is used to control something related to speed
       (gobo rotation, rainbow speed, tracking speed).</LI>
   <LI>The <B>Prism</B> type is used to control a prism.</LI>
   <LI>The <B>Shutter</B> type is used to control a shutter, a strobe or an iris.</LI>
   <LI>The <B>Beam</B> type is used to control a beam shaper (such as a zoom feature).</LI>
   <LI>The <B>Effect</B> type is used to control something that doesn't quite fit into any of the other groups.</LI>
   <LI>The <B>Maintenance</B> type is used to control feature such as resetting or a cooling fan
       or something similar.</LI>
   <LI>The <B>Nothing</B> type is used as a channel spacer or a place holder. Some channels
       of this type might be replaced with the <A HREF="">alias</A> feature.</LI>
   <LI>The <B>Pan</B> and <B>Tilt</B> types are used to control Pan/Tilt (or X/Y) features of
       moving heads or lasers</LI>
  </TD>
 </TR>
 <TR>
  <TD><B>Default value</B></TD>
  <TD>Specify the DMX value (0 to 255) to which a channel is set on power up. For example, some moving heads
      position their Pan/Tilt motors half way, which means the initial DMX channel value is equal to 127.
  </TD>
 </TR>
 <TR>
  <TD><B>Role</B></TD>
  <TD>
   Applicable to channel pairs that make 16 bit values, usually <B>Pan</B> or <B>Tilt</B> group, but some newer fixtures
   support 16 bit dimmer or even RGB, gobo or focus channels.<BR />
   For 8 bit values (e.g. when the fixture supports only 8bit movement, only one channel for each movement),
   assign the <B>Coarse (MSB)</B> control byte to the channel. If, however, the fixture supports 16bit
   (two channels for each feature), you should assign the <B>Coarse (MSB)</B> byte to the channels that
   provide coarse value and the <B>Fine (LSB)</B> byte to the channels that provide fine value adjustment.
   If you are not sure, use <B>Coarse MSB</B>.</LI>
  </TD>
 </TR>
 <TR>
  <TD>
   <B>Capabilities</B>
  </TD>
  <TD>
   Displays the list of DMX value ranges for the currently edited channel. If a
   channel provides only one capability (for example pan or dimmer) you should use a channel preset (see above).
   For more elaborate capabilities, such as colors or gobos, you should create
   capability ranges for each of the colors (for example 0-15 white, 16-32 blue...).<br>
   Specific ranges for each channel can be found in the product manual under the name "DMX chart".<br>
   Entering DMX ranges is pretty straight forward. The entry area is organized as a spreadsheet
   where range values and descriptions can be entered continuously just by pressing the TAB key.<br>
  </TD>
 </TR>
 <TR>
  <TD>
   <B>Preset</B>
  </TD>
  <TD>
   Each capability can be enriched with a so called "preset", which tells the QLC+ engine
   more useful information about a range of DMX values.<br>
   For example if the capability is "Shutter open", a preset called "ShutterOpen" is available so
   that QLC+ knows exactly how to treat the range.<br>
   Depending on the preset type, one or more additional information could be entered:
   <UL>
    <LI>ColorMacro: allows to pick a single color used tyipically on color wheels</LI>
    <LI>ColorDoubleMacro: allows to pick two colors to represent an intermediate
        position of a color wheel (Fig. 3)</LI>
    <LI>GoboMacro: allows to select a gobo picture to be used when entering the capability range (Fig. 4)</LI>
    <LI>StrobeFrequency: allows to enter a precise frequency (in Hertz) for a strobe feature</LI>
    <LI>StrobeFreqRange: allows to enter 2 values (minimum and maximum) to represent the range
        of frequencies (in Hertz) to simulate a strobo effect (Fig. 2)</LI>
    <LI>Alias: This is a special capability preset to indicate that when in this range, an alias
        should be triggered. An alias is a replacement of a channel. See the <A HREF="#aliases">Aliases tab</A>
        to understand how to define aliases</LI>

<H2 id="aliases">Aliases Tab</H2>

<P>
In this tab it is possible to define the rules of replacement triggered by capabilities set as "Alias" preset.<BR>
Let's make an example. A fixture has channel 5 named "Effects" which controls the behavior of channel 6.
Channel 5 has 2 capabilities: "Speed on channel 6" and "Sound sensitivity on channel 6".
The latter have been set to the "Alias" preset. By default, when DMX value of channel 5 is 0,
channel 6 acts as speed control. When DMX value of channel 5 enters the "sound sensitivity" capability,
channel 6 becomes a sound sensitivity adjustment.<BR>
To cope with this case, you need to define 2 channels: "Speed" and "Sound sensitivity". In the fixture mode
add only "Speed", since it will the default behavior when DMX value of channel 5 is equal to 0.<BR>
Then you need to define just one alias: the one that will replace the default channel "Speed"
with "Sound sensitivity". QLC+ will then know what to do when the DMX value
of channel 5 enters or exits the alias.
