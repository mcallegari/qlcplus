<P>
A Button is the simplest and at the same time one of the most powerful widget in QLC+;
with it, you can start, stop and flash your Functions.<br>
When activated in toggle mode, the Button border will turn to green, but if a Function
attached to a Button is started from another Virtual Console widget, the Button border
will turn to orange, to indicate that the Function is active but not actually controlled
by the Button. Pressing a Button in "monitoring" state will take control of the running Function
and the Button border will turn to green. Another press and the attached Function will be stopped.
