<P>
On the market you can easily find LED strips that you can wire as you prefer to create a RGB Panel (or matrix).
This dialog allows you to quickly create and setup a RGB Panel. It is a dedicated dialog to help you
with the most annoying process of creating fixtures manually depending on the desiderd layout.<BR>
Please note that once the panel is created, the only way to modify the layout is manually.
</P>

<H2>Panel creation</H2>
<P>
When clicking OK on this dialog two things will happen:<br>
<ul>
<li>QLC+ will create a fixture for each row of the panel. They can be considered like if
the panel is composed by individual RGB bars.</li>
<li>QLC+ will create a fixture group representing the panel with heads already in the right
displacement</li>
</ul>
Once a RGB panel is created, it is straight forward to go to the <a href="functionmanager.html">Function Manager</A>,
create a new <A HREF="file:concept.html#RGBMatrix">RGB Matrix</A> and start using the panel
very quickly.

Let's have a look at every option in this panel:
