<H1>Select Input Channel</H1>
<P>
Whenever an Input Channel needs to be selected, for example when manually
attaching a channel from an <A HREF="file:concept.html#InputPlugins">Input Plugin</A>
to a <A HREF="file:virtualconsole.html">Virtual Console</A> widget, the Select
Input Channel dialog is used.
</P>

<P>
The dialog is very straightforward; there is a list of input universes and each
universe that has an <A HREF="file:concept.html#Input">Input Line</A> attached to it,
displays the line's (or the attached device's) name after the universe number.
Under each operational universe, there is a list of channels provided by that
universe. You can choose from these channels or select one manually.
</P>

<P>
If you have an <A HREF="file:concept.html#InputProfiles">Input Profile</A> attached
to the universe, you see the individual channel names and numbers for the device.
If there isn't a Profile attached to an input universe, you will need to type
the channel number manually, by double-clicking the item that tells you to do that
and then type in the channel number manually. See also the 
<A HREF="file:howto-input-profiles.html">tutorial on input profiles</A>
</P>

<P>
<B>NOTE:</B> All <A HREF="file:virtualconsole.html">Virtual Console</A> widgets that
have been made <I>external-input-aware</I>, provide an option for
automatically detecting the input channel as well, so that you don't need do this
selection manually.
