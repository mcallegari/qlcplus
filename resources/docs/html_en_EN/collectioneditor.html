<H1>Collection Editor</H1>
<P>
The collection editor, as its name suggests, is used to edit
<IMG SRC="qrc:/collection.png" align="absmiddle"> <A HREF="file:concept.html#Collection">Collection</A> functions.<br>
Collections are very helpful in a workflow where you create QLC+ functions dedicated to specific areas of
your show. For example, you can create a number of Scenes to control only colors, some other Scenes to
control only positions and so on. Then you can create a number of Chasers and EFX for automations.<br>
When you have created all the basic elements of your show, you can then use Collections to build a sort of
"shortcut" to compound scenes. For example a color Scene + a position Scene.

<P>
<B>Note:</B> Collections don't have speed setting; each function you include
in a collection follows its own speed settings.
</P>

<P>
<B>Important</B>: The order of the Functions in a Collection is fundamental when dealing
with HTP/LTP usage or relative values. QLC+ will internally start the Functions of a Collection from the
first to the last, so if they use the same channels, just keep this in mind because
you might run into undesired effects.<BR>
For example a Scene setting Pan/Tilt channels + a EFX in relative mode must have a precise order: the Scene in the first
position and the EFX in the second position.
