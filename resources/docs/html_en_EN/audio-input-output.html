<H1>Audio Input/Output device selection</H1>

<p>This page describes how to select an input or output audio device
to be used inside QLC+.</p>

<P>
To access the Input/Output Manager, just click on the tab with the <img src="qrc:/input_output.png" width=32> icon
placed on the bottom of the QLC+ main screen.<br>
Select the desired universe on the left hand side of the screen and then click the
<u>Audio</u> tab placed beside the <u>Profile</u> tab on the top right hand side of the screen.
</P>

<P>
The list of audio devices detected by QLC+ is displayed. Each device has a checkbox
depending on if it supports input capture or audio output capabilities.<br>
The first entry of the list is always <B>"Default device"</B>, and it is selected as input
and output by default. In this way QLC+ will work in most of the cases out of the box.<br>
The default device is the one that you currently use to listen
to music or to record audio with a microphone.<br><br>
If in your system there are additional audio cards (PCI or USB), it is possible
to select them in this panel as the preferred QLC+ input or output device.<br>
Basically an input device is used by <A HREF="file:audiotriggers.html">Virtual Console Audio Triggers</A>
while an output device is used by <A HREF="file:concept.html#audio">audio functions</A>.<br><br>
The selection of an audio input/output line should take immediate effect in QLC+. If not
you are invited to restart QLC+ to allow a complete initialization of the internal audio engine.
