<H1>Scene Editor</H1>
<P>
The scene editor, as its name suggests, is used to edit
<IMG SRC="qrc:/scene.png" align="absmiddle"> <A HREF="file:concept.html#Scene">Scene</A> functions. The editor is divided into
tabs; with the first, <B>General</B> tab, you control the list of fixtures 
and <A HREF="file:concept.html#Channelgroups">channel groups</A> that take part in the scene editing,
together with the Scene name.<br>
All subsequent tabs are used to control the individual channel values for each fixture
and, if any are defined, the channels groups values.
</P>

<H2>General Tab Controls</H2>

<P>
On the left hand part of the screen, the buttons to control the fixtures used in the scene are displayed.<br>
</P>

<TABLE BORDER=1 class="qlcTable">
 <TR>
  <TD><B>Scene name</B></TD>
  <TD>Change the name of the scene.</TD>

 </TR>
</TABLE>

<P>
On the right hand part of the screen, the buttons to control the 
<A HREF="file:concept.html#Channelgroups">channel groups</A> used in the scene are displayed <br>
</P>

<TABLE BORDER="1" class="qlcTable">
 <TR>
  <TD><IMG SRC="qrc:/check.png"></TD>
  <TD>Enable all the selected channel groups.</TD>
 </TR>
 <TR>
  <TD><IMG SRC="qrc:/uncheck.png"></TD>
  <TD>Disable all the selected channel groups.</TD>
 </TR>
</TABLE>

<br>
<b>Hint:</b> It's useful to know that when a channels group is checked/unchecked, 
the fixtures controlled by the group will be automatically added to the left panel. 
The channels controlled by the group will also be automatically enabled/disabled on each fixture.

<H2>Channel Groups Tabs</H2>

<P>
This tab will be displayed only if one or more channel groups are selected in the General tab.<br>
Each Channel Group will be displayed with a quick macro access button 
(<A HREF="file:concept.html#ClickAndGo">Click And Go</A> if supported), 
a label with the group value, a fader and the name of the group.
</P>

<H2>Fixture Tabs</H2>

<P>
Each fixture is represented by its own tab that contains sliders for each of
the fixture's channels. Each channel can be enabled or disabled with a check
box at the top of the channel unit. The value of each channel can be set either by
typing the value to the edit box at the top of the slider or by moving the slider.
Channels that provide multiple functions such as gobos, colors, etc. also have
a button above the channel slider - this button can be used to directly select
a specific function or capability provided by that channel.<br>
<b>Hint</b>: The keyboard shortcut to move between channels values edit boxes is '<b>Tab</b>'
to move to the right and '<b>Shift + Tab</b>' to move to the left. </P> 

<H3>Channel enabled/disabled status</H3>

<P>
If a channel has not been enabled, the scene will not touch that particular
channel's value, ever.
</P>

<P>
If a channel has been enabled, the scene will change that channel's value to the
value that is defined in the scene. This is useful, for example, when you wish to
control only the dimmer channel of a scanner fixture - you wouldn't want the
scene to touch the scanner's pan, tilt, color or gobo channels when you just
want to fade in or fade out with the dimmer channel.
</P>
