<H1>Add/Edit Fixtures</H1>
<P>
The same dialog (with slight differences) is used for both adding new and
editing the properties of existing <A HREF="file:concept.html#Fixtures">Fixtures</A>.
</P>
<P>
<B>NOTE:</B> When editing an existing fixture, you can always choose a completely different
fixture type to replace the previous one, but if their channels don't match
each other exactly, any <A HREF="file:concept.html#Scene">Scene</A> functions you
may have created, will very probably do things that you don't want. Also, if
the channel counts don't match, you might end up having fixtures with overlapping
channels, which results also to unwanted behaviour.
<A HREF="file:concept.html#RGBMatrix">RGB Matrix</A>, <A HREF="file:concept.html#EFX">EFX</A>,
<A HREF="file:concept.html#Chaser">Chaser</A> and <A HREF="file:concept.html#Collection">Collection</A>
functions remain unaffected since they don't directly address specific channels, but are more
dynamic in nature.

   Shows you a list of available fixture definitions and their general types.
   If you don't see your favourite fixture definition on the list, you can
   create one yourself with the accompanying, easy to use <B>QLC+ Fixture Editor</B>.
   Since QLC+ is completely free software, please consider sharing the definition

    <LI>Universe: The DMX universe where the newly-added fixture(s) are connected to</LI>
    <LI>Address: The address of the (first) fixture you are adding. If you are
    adding multiple fixtures, each consecutive fixture will be assigned an
    address immediately after the previous fixture's channels, unless address gap
    (see below) is non-zero.</LI>
    <LI>Channels: If you have selected the <B>Generic</B> dimmer device, you
    can define its channel count to this field. Otherwise this field is read-only
    and it just tells you how many channels the currently selected fixture needs
    in its currently selected mode.</LI>
    <LI>Channel list: This field displays a more detailed list of individual
    channels for the currently selected fixture and its mode. For <B>Generic</B>
    dimmers, this field remains empty since all dimmer channels are treated as
    dummy <B>intensity</B> channels.</LI>

   These features are disabled when you are editing an existing fixture.
