<P>
A Cue List provides a list of <A HREF="concept.html#Functions">Functions</A> that
you can step through with a single keyboard key. The Cue List is designed for
theatrical performances where the lighting operator needs only to follow the script
and toggle the next cue as the performance goes on.
</P>

<P>
The first column on the Cue List displays the cue number that runs from 1 to
infinity and beyond<A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Lightyear">*</A>.
The second column shows the individual <A HREF="concept.html#Functions">Function</A>
name that has been assigned to that particular cue.
</P>

<P>
<b>Please note</b> that only <A HREF="concept.html#Chaser">Chasers</A>
can be assigned to a Cue List, for the simple reason that the Chaser
is the only function with a duration. Since any other Function can be added
as a step to a Chaser with the <A HREF="chasereditor.html">Chaser Editor</A>,
it is simple to create the desired Cues by mixing <A HREF="concept.html#Scene">Scenes</A>,
<A HREF="concept.html#Collection">Collections</A>, and so on...
</P>

Cue Lists can be configured with the object properties button

<P>
When switching QLC+ to <A HREF="concept.html#Modes">Operate Mode</A>, the Cue List will
become active, allowing the selection of the desired cues included in the associated Chaser.<br><br>
Pressing the ENTER key will start the selected cue.<br><br>
The following items are displayed at the bottom of the Cue List widget:<br><br>

   During the hold time the bar will be colored in <span style="background-color:#0F9BEC">blue</span>.
   The text displayed on the bar is the time remaining for the cue to end.<br>

    There are 3 playback states that a Cue list can assume: <b>running</b>, <b>paused</b> and <b>stopped</b>.<br>
    The layout of the playback control buttons can be decided in the configuration dialog, and the playback
    rules applied are always as follows:<br>

    <IMG src="qrc:/player_play.png"><br>
    When clicked from a stopped state, the playback starts from the currently selected cue. If no cue is
    selected, the playback starts from the first cue according to the associated Chaser running order.<br>
    Once clicked, the button icon changes depending on the chosen buttons layout, which could be "pause" or "stop".<br>
    When clicked from a paused state, the playback will be resumed from where it was left.<br><br>

    <IMG src="qrc:/player_pause.png"><br>
    When clicked, the playback of the currently running cues is paused, freezing everything that was running
    to the current state (lights will stay on, motors will stop moving, etc).<br>
    The button background will turn into a light blue, to indicate that clicking it again will resume
    the cue playback from where it was left.<br>
    <b>Note:</b> It is possible to pause fade in and hold phases, but not a fade out.<br><br>

    <IMG src="qrc:/player_stop.png"><br>
    When clicked, the currently running cue will be stopped, and the cue selection
    will stay on the last played cue. Any paused state will be reset and lights will be shut down.<br>
    If the buttons layout is "Play/Pause + Stop", pressing this button for the second time, will bring back
    the selected cue to the first cue of the Chaser (or the last if the running order is reversed)

<br>
<H3>Crossfade</H3>

<P>
  The side fader can be used to manually control crossfade between two consecutive cues.<br>
  <br>
  The numbers at the top and bottom of the fader show the "current cue" and "next cue".<br>
  The label for the current cue has a <span style="background-color:#4E8DDE">blue label</span>.
  This will be at 100% when the playback of the Cue List is started.<br>
  The label for the next cue has an <span style="background-color:orange">orange label</span> and will be
  at 0% when the playback of the Cue List is started.<br>
  <br>
  When the Cue list is running, the crossfade fader controls the intensity of the associated cues,
  overriding their Fade In and Fade Out speeds and so allowing manual control of the transition.<br>
  <br>
  After the fader has been moved to the opposite end of its travel, the following changes take place:<br>
  <UL>
   <LI>The orange <span style="background-color:orange">next cue</span> label changes to
    <span style="background-color:#4E8DDE">blue</span>. This indicates that the old next cue
    has become the new current cue.</LI>
   <LI>The blue <span style="background-color:#4E8DDE">current cue</span> label changes to
    <span style="background-color:orange">orange</span> and the number of the cue is increased by 2.
    So this fader now controls the cue which comes after the old next cue.</LI>
  </UL>
</P>

<br>
<H3>Hint</H3>

<P>
When a cue is added to a Chaser using the <A HREF="chasereditor.html">Chaser Editor</A>, the default
duration is set to 0.<br>
To avoid the cues in the Cue List looping frantically without any result, set the duration
of your cues, either by double clicking on the duration field or by using the
Speed Dial widget<IMG src="qrc:/speed.png"><br>
Note that if you need scenes that you're going to crossfade manually with the
Cue List widget, you probably will want to set the duration of the cues to "infinite" (&infin;) using
the <a href="vcspeeddial.html">Speed Dial widget</a>. This can be enabled in the Chaser Editor by
clicking on the <IMG src="qrc:/speed.png"> button.
