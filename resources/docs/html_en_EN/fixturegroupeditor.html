<H1>Fixture Group Editor</H1>
<P>
The Fixture Group Editor is used when you select a <A HREF="file:concept.html#FixtureGroup">Fixture
Group</A> in the <A HREF="file:fixturemanager.html">Fixture Manager</A>. This editor can be used
to describe the physical arrangement of the <A HREF="file:concept.html#Fixtures">fixtures</A> and
their <A HREF="file:concept.html#Head">heads</A> that are assigned to the group.
</P>

<H3>Controls</H3>

<P>
Each Fixture Group has a name (for your convenience) and the fixture configuration in an
unlimited [X,Y] grid. You can adjust the size of the grid as well as the placement of
individual fixture heads on the grid.
