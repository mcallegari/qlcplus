<h1>Input Profiles Howto</h1>

<p>
This howto document tells you how to associate input profiles to input universes
and how to edit these profiles. You should first read the
<A HREF="file:howto-input-output-mapping.html">howto on input/output mapping</A> so that you
can access the input/output manager and know how to edit input universes.
</p>

<h2>Input Profile Manager</h2>

<p>
画面下部の「入力/出力設定」をクリックしてInput / Output Managerを表示します。<br>
Select the desired universe on the left part of the screen and then click the
<u>Profile</u> tab placed beside the <u>Mapping</u> tab on the top right part of the screen.
</p>

<h2>Profile assignment</h2>

<p>
You will see a list of available input profile definitions, with a check mark
on <u>None</u>. This means that the current universe doesn't have a profile
assigned yet. To assign a profile to the universe, simply place a check mark
on one of the available profiles by clicking on the empty check box. Only one
profile can be assigned to one universe at a time, so the check mark will
actually <u>move</u> from its previous position to the item that you have just
selected.
</p>

<h2>Add/Edit a Profile</h2>

<p>
It is probable that your input profile is not on the list and you need to create
one on your own.
</p>

<P>
<B>Click the <IMG SRC="qrc:/edit_add.png"> create new input profile button
to start making a profile definition for your input profile. Alternatively, you
can edit any existing profile by selecting the appropriate item and clicking
the <IMG SRC="qrc:/edit.png"> edit button. The procedure is exactly the
same in both cases from now on.</B>
</P>

<h2>Input Profile Editor</h2>

<p>
A dialog is opened with entry fields for <u>Manufacturer</u>, <u>Model</u> and <u>Type</u>.
</p>

<p>
<b>First enter the profile's manufacturer and the model to these fields and select profile type.</b>
</p>

<P><B>Type</b> is one of:
<UL>
<LI>MIDI - for MIDI profiles, usually used with <A HREF="file:midiplugin.html">MIDI plugin</A></LI>
<LI>OSC - for OSC profiles, used with <A HREF="file:oscplugin.html">OSC plugin</A></LI>
<LI>HID - for HID profiles, used with <A HREF="file:hidplugin.html">HID plugin</A></LI>
<LI>DMX - generic DMX profiles</LI>
<LI>ENTTEC - ENTTEC Wing profiles, used with Enttec Wing plugin</LI>
</UL>

So far, the only difference is that MIDI profiles show MIDI message parameters in the channel editor.
</p>

<p>
<b>Now click the <u>Channels</u> tab to edit the profile's channels.</b>
You have two choices for adding channel definitions: <u>Manual</u> and <u>Automatic</u>:
</P>
<HR>
<P>
<H3>Manual mode</H3>
<P>
<IMG SRC="qrc:/edit_add.png" ALIGN="absmiddle"> Click the add button to
enter individual channel information by hand for each channel.<BR>
<IMG SRC="qrc:/edit_remove.png"> Click to remove an existing channel<br>
</P>

<H3>Automatic mode</H3>
<P>
<IMG SRC="qrc:/wizard.png" ALIGN="absmiddle"> Click the automatic wizard
button to attempt automatic channel detection. You'll receive further
instructions from QLC+. You must have an
<A HREF="file:howto-input-output-mapping.html">input plugin</A> assigned to the current
universe for this feature to work. Also, you must first stop the wizard to
be able to navigate away from this dialog page.
</P>
<HR>

<H3>Channel properties</H3>
<P>
When you add <IMG SRC="qrc:/edit_add.png" ALIGN="absmiddle"> or
edit <IMG SRC="qrc:/edit.png" ALIGN="absmiddle"> a channel, a small window
will be displayed, asking you to fill or change some parameters:
<ul>
 <li><b>Number</b>: The channel number. Since QLC+ supports a wide variety of
     input plugins, the channel number might not be intuitive, so only edit this if
     you know what you're doing.
 </li>
 <li><b>Name</b>: The channel name. This is an arbitrary string to indicate
     the purpose of a channel.
 </li>
 <li><b>Type</b>: The channel type. This can be:
   <IMG SRC="qrc:/slider.png" ALIGN="absmiddle"> Slider,
   <IMG SRC="qrc:/knob.png" ALIGN="absmiddle"> Knob,
   <IMG SRC="qrc:/button.png" ALIGN="absmiddle"> Button or
   <IMG SRC="qrc:/knob.png" ALIGN="absmiddle"> Encoder<BR>
   Other types:
   <IMG SRC="qrc:/back.png" ALIGN="absmiddle"> Previous page,
   <IMG SRC="qrc:/forward.png" ALIGN="absmiddle"> Next Page,
   <IMG SRC="qrc:/star.png" ALIGN="absmiddle"> Set Page are used to control multipage frames.
 </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
For MIDI profiles the dialog contains additional fields:
<ul>
<li>チャンネル</li>
<li>メッセージ</li>
<li>param2</li>
<li>注意</li>
</ul>
where you can enter the channel specification (which translates to channel number) in a more intuitive way.
</p>
<br>
<b>Note that you cannot add the same channel multiple times to one profile.</b>
</p>

<H3><IMG SRC="qrc:/slider.png" ALIGN="absmiddle"> Sliders movement properties</H3>
<P>
If your input profile includes slider channels,
when you click on them you'll notice some extra properties showing up at the bottom of
the input profile editor main window. With those, you can set how values received
from a slider should act within QLC+.<br><br>
There are two behaviours: <u>Absolute</u> and <u>Relative</u>.<br><br>
<b>Absolute</b> is the default setting and basically tells QLC+ to use the slider values
exactly as they are received from an external controller.<br>
<br>
<b>Relative</b> is a more advanced behaviour that comes handy when using a HID Joystick
with a QLC+ <A HREF="file:vcxypad.html">XY Pad widget</a> or a
<A HREF="file:vcslider.html">Slider widget</a>. Values received from an external controller
are treated as relative movement starting from the current position of a Virtual Console
widget.<br>
Let's make an example. Suppose you have a XY Pad in your Virtual Console, controlling and monitoring
a group of moving heads. During your show you will have a number of scenes moving the heads
pan and tilt. At some point you want to slightly adjust the position of the heads of just a few
degrees. Here is when the relative movement kicks in. When you move your joystick (or external slider)
QLC+ will adjust the heads from their current positions. The direction will depend directly
from your external controller. The relative movement will stop when the external controller
will return to its origin. Joysticks have a spring for that.<br>
In addition to this, the Input Profile Editor Relative setting allows you to set a <b>Sensitivity</b>
parameter that will instruct QLC+ about the strenght of your external controller movements.
The higher this value is, the slower the movements will occur. The lower, the faster.
</P>
<HR>

<H3><IMG SRC="qrc:/knob.png" ALIGN="absmiddle"> Encoder properties</H3>
<P>
An encoder is an endless rotary control and can be treated only as a relative control. Basically the encoder
can start at any position and when turned clockwise or counter-clockwise it will generate positive or
negative offsets inside QLC+.
When an Input Profile channel is set to the Encoder type, it is possible to specify a <b>sensitivity</b>
value, which is nothing but the relative offset that will be added to or subtracted from the current QLC+
channel value.
</P>
<HR>

<H3><IMG SRC="qrc:/button.png" ALIGN="absmiddle"> Button properties</H3>
<P>
It is possible to change the behaviour of individual buttons from an input profile, and
the following properties will be used globally in QLC+.

<b>Generate an extra Press/Release when toggled</b>: this is a quite specific option used for
example when dealing with TouchOSC or the Behringer BCF2000.<br>
QLC+ toggle events are triggered when a high+low sequence is received. This means that QLC+ expects a
non zero value (typically 255) followed by a zero value to toggle, for example, a button.<br>
Devices like BCF2000 or softwares like TouchOSC, instead, send just a non zero value when activating
a button, and a zero value when deactivating it.<br>
When checking this option, QLC+ will generate the "missing" events to standardize the way some controller
work. So, for example, the BCF2000 will look like sending 255+0 when pressing a button, and
another 255+0 when pressing it again.<br><br>
<b>Custom feedback</b>: with the "Lower value" and "Upper value" boxes, it is possible to force
custom values to be sent when the selected button sends a non-zero and a zero value.<br>
For example, with this option it is possible to set globally how Akai APC devices LEDs should be
colored when activated/deactivated.<br>
Note that this option is global in QLC+, but it can be overridden if needed by a specific Virtual Console
widget, through its configuration page.

<h2>Back to the input profile definitions panel</h2>

<p>
When you're done with channels mapping, click the OK button to accept changes and save the
input profile. If you didn't enter a manufacturer/model for the profile,
you'll be prompted to enter them before you can continue.<br>

Now you should see the profile you just defined in the list of available input
profiles. Remember how to assign it to the current universe? Scroll up to
<u>Profile assignment</u> if you don't.
</p>

<p>
To remove any existing input profiles, click the
<IMG SRC="qrc:/edit_remove.png"> remove button. Note that some profiles are
so-called <u>system profiles</u> and cannot be removed unless you're the
administrator.
</p>

<p>以上です！<br>
Now you can start using your preferred profile. When assigining
an input channel to a QLC+ element (like Virtual Console sliders, channel groups, etc..)
you will see that your Input profile mapping will be used.
