<h1>Input/Output Mapping Howto</h1>

<p>This howto document tells you how to patch plugins and their input/output lines
(physical input/output devices) to QLC+'s universes.</p>

<p>
By default QLC+ provides 4 universes but you can add/remove them as needed.<br>
The input/output mapping is saved in the currently loaded project.
This allows you to port your project on another computer/OS without the need to
reconfigure it every time.<br>
If no project is loaded, QLC+ will keep the I/O mapping as a "fallback" configuration.
</p>

<h2 id="input-output-manager">Input/Output Manager</h2>

<p>
画面下部の「入力/出力設定」をクリックしてInput / Output Managerを表示します。<br>
The screen is composed in this way:<br>
<ul>
 <li>On the left hand side there is the list of internal universes that QLC+ can manage</li>
 <li>On the right hand side there is the list of devices and their mapped inputs, outputs and feedback lines that QLC+ has detected</li>
 <li>On the bottom right hand side there is a panel displaying brief information on the currently selected device</li>
</ul>

Every device has a checkbox whenever an input, output or feedback line is available.<br>
Each QLC+ universe can map a single input, a single output and a single feedback line<br>
</p>

<P>
Some plugins might require configuration before they can be used' so you might
not be able to see all inputs/outputs at first. The configuration button
is place next to the information panel and it is enabled if the plugin
allows any manual setting.<br>
The button icon is: <IMG SRC="qrc:/configure.png" width=32>
</P>

<h2 ="">Adding/Removing universes</h2>

<p>
QLC+ supports any number of universes, depending on the CPU limit of the device controlling them.<br>
On the left hand side of the Input/Output Manager there is a toolbar where you can add/remove, name
and configure universes.
</p>

<table border="1" class="qlcTable">
 <tr>
  <td><img src="qrc:/edit_add.png"></td>
  <td>Add a new universe. The universe will have a name like "Universe X",
      where X is a progressive number assigned by QLC+ (and also the Universe ID).
  </td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td><img src="qrc:/edit_remove.png"></td>
  <td>Remove the currently selected universe.<br>
      <b>Please be careful with this operation as it can compromise your project and cannot be reverted.</b><br>
      When deleting a universe, if it is currently patched or some fixtures are mapped
      on it, a popup message will appear asking for confirmation if the operation should
      be completed or abandoned.
  </td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td><b>Universe name</b></td>
  <td>An arbitrary string that you can set to quickly identify the meaning of a Universe</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td><b>Passthrough</b></td>
  <td>下記を参照してください。</td>
 </tr>
</table>

<h2 id="patching">パッチ</h2>

<p>
To patch a plugin's input/output line to the selected universe, you need to place
a checkmark on that particular plugin's input/output line. You can have only one
line assigned to a universe at a time, so when you check another line, the
checkmark will <u>move</u> from its previous position to the one you just checked.<br>
If you don't see any line on a plugin, it means you don't have any device that QLC+
understands and you're left with the one and only (non-selectable) choice: <u>None</u>.
</p>

<p>
When an input/output line is checked, the corresponding universe information on the left hand side of the screen
will change and will display the new configuration set.<br>
The plugin information on the bottom right hand side of the screen will change as well and will give
you the new status of the plugin line.
</p>

<h2 id="passthrough">Universe Passthrough</h2>

<p>
When passthrough is enabled, universe just forwards what it receives in its input line to its output line.
This is useful for several things:
<ul>
<li><b>Protocol converter</b>: when you want to use QLC+ to act as a
    "protocol" converter. For example you can use this feature to
    transparently map an ArtNet network to a DMX USB adapter or even MIDI.
</li>
<li><b>Monitor external data</b>: patch fixtures and watch the data in DMX
    monitor
</li>
<li><b>Merge data from external controller</b>: Have external lighting desk
    control some of the channels independently (for example conventionals)
    and QLC+ control intelligent lights on the same universe.</li>
<li><b>Raspberry Pi</b>: forward data from QLC+ on PC while programming scenes;
    when the workspace is transferred, Raspberry becomes main controller; the
    devices are always connected to RPi</li>
</ul>

<p>Passthrough data is not affected by QLC+ grandmaster or channel modifiers.
   It is merged in HTP fashion with QLC+ output if there are any fixtures
   patched at that channel (Note: it does not use LTP/HTP channel settings).
   Blackout affects passthrough data.
</p>

<h2 id="input-and-feedback">Input and Feedbacks</h2>

<p>
When a plugin input line is checked, it gets enabled right away, so you can perform a basic test
to double check if your hardware is working properly with QLC+.<br>
Just move a fader/knob on your external device, and if everything works fine, you will see a
<img src="qrc:/input.png" width="32"> icon appearing beside the corresponding universe
on the left side of the screen.
</p>

<p>
If your input device supports a return channel, QLC+ can send a visual/mechanical feedback
to it. Devices such as Behringer BCF2000 support this feature.<br>
At the moment feedbacks are supported only through MIDI, OSC and loopback.
</p>
