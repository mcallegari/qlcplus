<H1><img src="qrc:/monitor.png" width=32> DMX Monitor</H1>
<P>
The DMX Monitor is a useful tool to track the values that are being sent to the
output universes. Only the information related to the required fixtures are
displayed. The monitor's display options have no effect on actual fixture
addressing, after all, it is just a <B>monitor</B>.<br>
The DMX monitor has two display modes: <B>DMX view</B> and <B>2D view</B>.
</P>

<H2>DMX view</H2>
<P>
The DMX view shows the all the fixtures of the project, representing each 
channel with numbers and icons. It basically represents each channel in 3 rows:
<UL>
 <LI>The channel group icon</LI>
 <LI>The channel number</LI>
 <LI>The channel value</LI>
</UL>
</P>

  <TD>
   Change the monitor font. To prevent the numbers from flickering and jumping,
   you should choose a proportional (i.e. fixed width) font; for example
   Monaco, Andale or Courier. The font property is global, meaning it will not be
   saved into your current project, but it will be stored in the QLC+ main
   configuration.
  </TD>

 <TR>
  <TD>
   <B>DMX Channels</B>

</TABLE>

<H2>2D view</H2>
<P>
The monitor 2D view is another way to represent the fixtures of your project
that, instead of numbers, uses a graphical preview trying to represent as much
as possible the real result of a light-emitting device.</P>
<P>Currently, monitor reflects:
<UL>
  <LI>Master Dimmer</LI>
  <LI>R/G/B</LI>
  <LI>C/M/Y</LI>
  <LI>Color wheels, if they contain RGB color value. Two-color values are not supported</LI>
  <LI>Shutter, which is open, unless the capability name contains "close" or "blackout" (example: "Shutter Close")</LI>
</UL></P>
<P>In 2D view mode it is possible to select which fixtures to display and their 
position in a grid representing the dimensions of a real stage.<br>
The grid would like to reproduce the front view of a stage, but you can
use it as a generic space as you might like.<br>
Graphical items can be manually moved by dragging them over the grid, or,
when clicked, they can be configured with the Monitor Fixture Editor
panel that will be displayed on the right side of the window.

PAN/TILT display is schematically displayed using colored rings/arcs around fixture.
<span style="background-color: purple"><b>P</b>urple</span> arc shows <b>P</b>AN angle, and <span style="background-color: turquoise"><b>T</b>urquoise</span> arc shows <b>T</b>ILT angle.
Gray dots show PAN/TILT ranges. Zero (middle of the range) is at the bottom.

<P>
In the folowing picture PAN range is 660 degrees and tilt range is 300 degrees. Pan is at counter-clockwise end (-330 deg) and tilt is at -150 deg.
