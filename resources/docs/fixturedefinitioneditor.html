<P>
Fixture Definition Editor is a separate application for creating and modifying
<A HREF="file:concept.html#Fixtures">fixture definitions</A> used by QLC+. The
definitions tell QLC+ (and users) important details about fixtures, such as
which channel is used for pan movement, what value in which channel changes
the beam color green, how the fixture is reset etc...
</P>

<P>
The main window in the Fixture Editor is just an empty workspace that contains
the actual editor windows used to actually edit fixture definitions.
</P>

<P>
<B>Important note: for many reasons, you SHOULD NOT save or copy your custom fixtures in the
QLC+ system fixtures folder. The most important is that when you uninstall QLC+, the system
fixtures folder gets deleted, so your fixtures.<br>
You are recommended to save them in the user fixtures folder. To find it, please refer to the
<A HREF="file:questionsandanswers.html">Q & A section</A> of this documentation.
