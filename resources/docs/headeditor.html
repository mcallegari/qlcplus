<H1>Head Editor</H1>
<P>
The Head Editor is used to create and edit <A HREF="file:concept.html#Head">heads</A>
by picking sets of <B>Channels</B> that are dedicated to a single head (as defined by the
fixture's manufacturer).
</P>

<H3>Controls</H3>

<P>
The controls are very simple: place a checkmark on each channel that is used ONLY by the
head you are currently editing. To add a head, see <A HREF="modeeditor.html">Mode Editor</A>.<BR>
When adding heads in a <A HREF="file:concept.html#FixtureMode">fixture mode</A> that provides 
a master dimmer channel, you can include that channel on each head. In this way a
<A HREF="file:concept.html#RGBMatrix">RGB matrix</A> function will be able to control
your heads out of the box, with no need to manual dim your matrices.
</P>

<TABLE BORDER=1 class="qlcTable">
 <TR>
  <TD>
   <B>Channel list</B>
  </TD>
  <TD>
   Displays the list of all fixture channels available in the current mode. Channels that
   have been assigned to another head are disabled and cannot be selected because each
   channel can only belong to one head at a time.
