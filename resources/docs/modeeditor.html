<H1>Mode Editor</H1>
<P>
The Mode Editor is used to create and edit <A HREF="file:concept.html#FixtureMode">
modes</A> by picking sets of <B>Channels</B> in certain order (as defined by
the fixture's manufacturer). Each editor window is divided into three tabs:
Channels, Heads and Physical.
</P>

<H3>Controls - Channels Tab</H3>

<P>
In the Channels tab you can place the fixture's channels in an order that forms
an actual representation of the DMX channels that the fixture understands when it
has been configured in that particular mode.
</P>

<TABLE BORDER=1 class="qlcTable">
 <TR>
  <TD>
   <B>Mode Name</B>
  </TD>
  <TD>
   The name of the mode (must be unique for each mode).
  </TD>
 </TR>
 <TR>
  <TD>
   <B>Channel list</B>
  </TD>
  <TD>
   Displays all channels present in the current mode in their proper order.
  </TD>
 </TR>
 <TR>
  <TD>
   <IMG SRC="qrc:/edit_add.png"/>
  </TD>
  <TD>
   Add channels from the fixture's channel collection to the mode.
   You can create/edit channels in the <A HREF="file:fixtureeditor.html">Fixture
   Editor's</A> <B>Channels</B> tab.<br>
   When you click on this button a new window will be displayed, showing two lists:
   <ul>
    <li>The list on the left shows the channels that have not yet been added to this mode.
    If you're creating a new mode, this list will show all the channels you created
    in the Fixture Editor's channels tab</li>
    <li>The list on the right shows the channels that define the mode you're editing.
    If you're creating a new mode, this list will be empty.<br>
    Please note that the order of the channels in this list is fundamental to the 
    fixture mode definition.
   </ul>
   To move items from one list to another either use the central buttons or simply
   drag and drop them.<br>
   When done, press OK to update the mode channel list.
  </TD>
 </TR>
 <TR>
  <TD>
   <IMG SRC="qrc:/edit_remove.png"/>
  </TD>
  <TD>
   Remove the selected channels from the mode. Other modes' channel selections
   are left untouched.
  </TD>
 </TR>

   Raise the selected channel up by one.

  </TD>
  <TD>
   Lower the selected channel down by one.
  </TD>
 </TR>
</TABLE>

<H3>Controls - Heads Tab</H3>

<P>
In the Heads tab you can define multiple <A HREF="file:concept.html#Head">heads</A> for a
single fixture, so that QLC+ knows to treat each of them individually in certain
situations (such as <A HREF="file:concept.html#FixtureGroup">Fixture Groups</A>). If a fixture
contains only one head when it's configured to use the currently edited mode (i.e. all
of the mode's channels control one head at a time) there is no need to define the head. If,
however, the fixture has multiple heads that you wish to be able to control, you must define
each head here.
</P>

<P>
Heads don't have names as they can be thought of as simple "sub-fixtures" inside a fixture.
Instead, they are automatically given index numbers. The ordering of the Heads should follow the
physical fixture's configuration as closely as possible. So, if the heads go 1, 2, 3, 4 in
the real world, don't define them as 4, 2, 1, 3 or something equally annoying.
</P>

<TABLE BORDER=1 class="qlcTable">

</TABLE>

<H3>Controls - Physical Tab</H3>

<P>
Because some fixtures allow their physical properties (e.g. pan/tilt range)
to be altered between modes, it is beneficial that the fixture's actual
physical properties are also tied to fixture modes.
